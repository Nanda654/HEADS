Daniel Radcliffe as Harry Potter in \"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix\" To the disappointment of gossip columnists around the world, the young actor says he has no plans to fritter his cash away on fast cars, drink and celebrity parties. \"I don\\'t plan to be one of those people who, as soon as they turn 18, suddenly buy themselves a massive sports car collection or something similar,\" he told an Australian interviewer earlier this month. \"I don\\'t think I\\'ll be particularly extravagant. \"The things I like buying are things that cost about 10 pounds -- books and CDs and DVDs.\" At 18, Radcliffe will be able to gamble in a casino, buy a drink in a pub or see the horror film \"Hostel: Part II,\" currently six places below his number one movie on the UK box office chart. Details of how he\\'ll mark his landmark birthday are under wraps. His agent and publicist had no comment on his plans. \"I\\'ll definitely have some sort of party,\" he said in an interview. \"Hopefully none of you will be reading about it.\" Radcliffe\\'s earnings from the first five Potter films have been held in a trust fund which he has not been able to touch. Despite his growing fame and riches, the actor says he is keeping his feet firmly on the ground. \"People are always looking to say \\'kid star goes off the rails,\\'\" he told reporters last month. \"But I try very hard not to go that way because it would be too easy for them.\" His latest outing as the boy wizard in \"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix\" is breaking records on both sides of the Atlantic and he will reprise the role in the last two films.

The hardy colonist, and the trained European who\\nfought at his side, frequently expended months in struggling against the\\nrapids of the streams, or in effecting the rugged passes of the\\nmountains, in quest of an opportunity to exhibit their courage in a more\\nmartial conflict. But, emulating the patience and self-denial of the\\npractised native warriors, they learned to overcome every difficulty;\\nand it would seem that, in time, there was no recess of the woods so\\ndark, nor any secret place so lovely, that it might claim exemption from\\nthe inroads of those who had pledged their blood to satiate their\\nvengeance, or to uphold the cold and selfish policy of the distant\\nmonarchs of Europe.\\n\\nPerhaps no district throughout the wide extent of the intermediate\\nfrontiers can furnish a livelier picture of the cruelty and fierceness\\nof the savage warfare of those periods than the country which lies\\nbetween the head waters of the Hudson and the adjacent lakes.\\n\\nThe facilities which nature had there offered to the march of the\\ncombatants were too obvious to be neglected. The lengthened sheet of the\\nChamplain stretched from the frontiers of Canada, deep within the\\nborders of the neighboring province of New York, forming a natural\\npassage across half the distance that the French were compelled to\\nmaster in order to strike their enemies. Near its southern termination,\\nit received the contributions of another lake, whose waters were so\\nlimpid as to have been exclusively selected by the Jesuit missionaries\\nto perform the typical purification of baptism, and to obtain for it the\\ntitle of lake \"du Saint Sacrement.\" The less zealous English thought\\nthey conferred a sufficient honor on its unsullied fountains, when they\\nbestowed the name of their reigning prince, the second of the house of\\nHanover. The two united to rob the untutored possessors of its wooded\\nscenery of their native right to perpetuate its original appellation of\\n\"Horican.\"[1]\\n\\nWinding its way among countless islands, and imbedded in mountains, the\\n\"holy lake\" extended a dozen leagues still farther to the south. With\\nthe high plain that there interposed itself to the further passage of\\nthe water, commenced a portage of as many miles, which conducted the\\nadventurer to the banks of the Hudson, at a point where, with the usual\\nobstructions of the rapids, or rifts, as they were then termed in the\\nlanguage of the country, the river became navigable to the tide.\\n\\nWhile, in the pursuit of their daring plans of annoyance, the restless\\nenterprise of the French even attempted the distant and difficult gorges\\nof the Alleghany, it may easily be imagined that their proverbial\\nacuteness would not overlook the natural advantages of the district we\\nhave just described. It became, emphatically, the bloody arena, in which\\nmost of the battles for the mastery of the colonies were contested.\\nForts were erected at the different points that commanded the facilities\\nof the route, and were taken and retaken, razed and rebuilt, as victory\\nalighted on the hostile banners. While the husbandman shrank back from\\nthe dangerous passes, within the safer boundaries of the more ancient\\nsettlements, armies larger than those that had often disposed of the\\nsceptres of the mother countries, were seen to bury themselves in these\\nforests, whence they rarely returned but in skeleton bands, that were\\nhaggard with care, or dejected by defeat. Though the arts of peace were\\nunknown to this fatal region, its forests were alive with men; its\\nshades and glens rang with the sounds of martial music, and the echoes\\nof its mountains threw back the laugh, or repeated the wanton cry, of\\nmany a gallant and reckless youth, as he hurried by them, in the\\nnoontide of his spirits, to slumber in a long night of forgetfulness.\\n\\nIt was in this scene of strife and bloodshed that the incidents we shall\\nattempt to relate occurred, during the third year of the war which\\nEngland and France last waged for the possession of a country that\\nneither was destined to retain.\\n\\nThe imbecility of her military leaders abroad, and the fatal want of\\nenergy in her councils at home, had lowered the character of Great\\nBritain from the proud elevation on which it had been placed, by the\\ntalents and enterprise of her former warriors and statesmen. No longer\\ndreaded by her enemies, her servants were fast losing the confidence of\\nself-respect. In this mortifying abasement, the colonists, though\\ninnocent of her imbecility, and too humble to be the agents of her\\nblunders, were but the natural participators.\\n\\nThey had recently seen a chosen army from that country, which,\\nreverencing as a mother, they had blindly believed invincible--an army\\nled by a chief who had been selected from a crowd of trained warriors,\\nfor his rare military endowments, disgracefully routed by a handful of\\nFrench and Indians, and only saved from annihilation by the coolness and\\nspirit of a Virginian boy, whose riper fame has since diffused itself,\\nwith the steady influence of moral truth, to the uttermost confines of\\nChristendom.[2] A wide frontier had been laid naked by this unexpected\\ndisaster, and more substantial evils were preceded by a thousand\\nfanciful and imaginary dangers. The alarmed colonists believed that the\\nyells of the savages mingled with every fitful gust of wind that issued\\nfrom the interminable forests of the west. The terrific character of\\ntheir merciless enemies increased immeasurably the natural horrors of\\nwarfare. Numberless recent massacres were still vivid in their\\nrecollections; nor was there any ear in the provinces so deaf as not to\\nhave drunk in with avidity the narrative of some fearful tale of\\nmidnight murder, in which the natives of the forests were the principal\\nand barbarous actors. As the credulous and excited traveller related the\\nhazardous chances of the wilderness, the blood of the timid curdled\\nwith terror, and mothers cast anxious glances even at those children\\nwhich slumbered within the security of the largest towns. In short, the\\nmagnifying influence of fear began to set at naught the calculations of\\nreason, and to render those who should have remembered their manhood,\\nthe slaves of the basest of passions. Even the most confident and the\\nstoutest hearts began to think the issue of the contest was becoming\\ndoubtful; and that abject class was hourly increasing in numbers, who\\nthought they foresaw all the possessions of the English crown in America\\nsubdued by their Christian foes, or laid waste by the inroads of their\\nrelentless allies.\\n\\nWhen, therefore, intelligence was received at the fort, which covered\\nthe southern termination of the portage between the Hudson and the\\nlakes, that Montcalm had been seen moving up the Champlain, with an army\\n\"numerous as the leaves on the trees,\" its truth was admitted with more\\nof the craven reluctance of fear than with the stern joy that a warrior\\nshould feel, in finding an enemy within reach of his blow. The news had\\nbeen brought, towards the decline of a day in midsummer, by an Indian\\nrunner, who also bore an urgent request from Munro, the commander of a\\nwork on the shore of the \"holy lake,\" for a speedy and powerful\\nreinforcement. It has already been mentioned that the distance between\\nthese two posts was less than five leagues. The rude path, which\\noriginally formed their line of communication, had been widened for the\\npassage of wagons; so that the distance which had been travelled by the\\nson of the forest in two hours, might easily be effected by a detachment\\nof troops, with their necessary baggage, between the rising and setting\\nof a summer sun. The loyal servants of the British crown had given to\\none of these forest fastnesses the name of William Henry, and to the\\nother that of Fort Edward; calling each after a favorite prince of the\\nreigning family. The veteran Scotchman just named held the first, with a\\nregiment of regulars and a few provincials; a force really by far too\\nsmall to make head against the formidable power that Montcalm was\\nleading to the foot of his earthen mounds. At the latter, however, lay\\nGeneral Webb, who commanded the armies of the king in the northern\\nprovinces, with a body of more than five thousand men. By uniting the\\nseveral detachments of his command, this officer might have arrayed\\nnearly double that number of combatants against the enterprising\\nFrenchman, who had ventured so far from his reinforcements, with an army\\nbut little superior in numbers.\\n\\nBut under the influence of their degraded fortunes, both officers and\\nmen appeared better disposed to await the approach of their formidable\\nantagonists, within their works, than to resist the progress of their\\nmarch, by emulating the successful example of the French at Fort du\\nQuesne, and striking a blow on their advance.\\n\\nAfter the first surprise of the intelligence had a little abated, a\\nrumor was spread through the entrenched camp, which stretched along the\\nmargin of the Hudson, forming a chain of outworks to the body of the\\nfort itself, that a chosen detachment of fifteen hundred men was to\\ndepart, with the dawn, for William Henry, the post at the northern\\nextremity of the portage. That which at first was only rumor, soon\\nbecame certainty, as orders passed from the quarters of the\\ncommander-in-chief to the several corps he had selected for this\\nservice, to prepare for their speedy departure. All doubt as to the\\nintention of Webb now vanished, and an hour or two of hurried footsteps\\nand anxious faces succeeded. The novice in the military art flew from\\npoint to point, retarding his own preparations by the excess of his\\nviolent and somewhat distempered zeal; while the more practised veteran\\nmade his arrangements with a deliberation that scorned every appearance\\nof haste; though his sober lineaments and anxious eye sufficiently\\nbetrayed that he had no very strong professional relish for the as yet\\nuntried and dreaded warfare of the wilderness. At length the sun set in\\na flood of glory, behind the distant western hills, and as darkness drew\\nits veil around the secluded spot the sounds of preparation diminished;\\nthe last light finally disappeared from the log cabin of some officer;\\nthe trees cast their deeper shadows over the mounds and the rippling\\nstream, and a silence soon pervaded the camp, as deep as that which\\nreigned in the vast forest by which it was environed.\\n\\nAccording to the orders of the preceding night, the heavy sleep of the\\narmy was broken by the rolling of the warning drums, whose rattling\\nechoes were heard issuing, on the damp morning air, out of every vista\\nof the woods, just as day began to draw the shaggy outlines of some tall\\npines of the vicinity, on the opening brightness of a soft and cloudless\\neastern sky. In an instant the whole camp was in motion; the meanest\\nsoldier arousing from his lair to witness the departure of his\\ncomrades, and to share in the excitement and incidents of the hour. The\\nsimple array of the chosen band was soon completed. While the regular\\nand trained hirelings of the king marched with haughtiness to the right\\nof the line, the less pretending colonists took their humbler position\\non its left, with a docility that long practice had rendered easy. The\\nscouts departed; strong guards preceded and followed the lumbering\\nvehicles that bore the baggage; and before the gray light of the morning\\nwas mellowed by the rays of the sun, the main body of the combatants\\nwheeled into column, and left the encampment with a show of high\\nmilitary bearing, that served to drown the slumbering apprehensions of\\nmany a novice, who was now about to make his first essay in arms. While\\nin view of their admiring comrades, the same proud front and ordered\\narray was observed, until the notes of their fifes growing fainter in\\ndistance, the forest at length appeared to swallow up the living mass\\nwhich had slowly entered its bosom.\\n\\nThe deepest sounds of the retiring and invisible column had ceased to be\\nborne on the breeze to the listeners, and the latest straggler had\\nalready disappeared in pursuit; but there still remained the signs of\\nanother departure, before a log cabin of unusual size and\\naccommodations, in front of which those sentinels paced their rounds,\\nwho were known to guard the person of the English general. At this spot\\nwere gathered some half dozen horses, caparisoned in a manner which\\nshowed that two, at least, were destined to bear the persons of females,\\nof a rank that it was not usual to meet so far in the wilds of the\\ncountry. A third wore the trappings and arms of an officer of the staff;\\nwhile the rest, from the plainness of the housings, and the travelling\\nmails with which they were encumbered, were evidently fitted for the\\nreception of as many menials, who were, seemingly, already awaiting the\\npleasure of those they served. At a respectful distance from this\\nunusual show were gathered divers groups of curious idlers; some\\nadmiring the blood and bone of the high-mettled military charger, and\\nothers gazing at the preparations, with dull wonder of vulgar curiosity.\\nThere was one man, however, who, by his countenance and actions, formed\\na marked exception to those who composed the latter class of spectators,\\nbeing neither idle, nor seemingly very ignorant.\\n\\nThe person of this individual was to the last degree ungainly, without\\nbeing in any particular manner deformed. He had all the bones and joints\\nof other men, without any of their proportions. Erect, his stature\\nsurpassed that of his fellows; seated, he appeared reduced within the\\nordinary limits of the race. The same contrariety in his members seemed\\nto exist throughout the whole man. His head was large; his shoulders\\nnarrow; his arms long and dangling; while his hands were small, if not\\ndelicate. His legs and thighs were thin, nearly to emaciation, but of\\nextraordinary length; and his knees would have been considered\\ntremendous, had they not been outdone by the broader foundations on\\nwhich this false superstructure of the blended human orders was so\\nprofanely reared. The ill-assorted and injudicious attire of the\\nindividual only served to render his awkwardness more conspicuous. A\\nsky-blue coat, with short and broad skirts and low cape, exposed a long\\nthin neck, and longer and thinner legs, to the worst animadversions of\\nthe evil disposed. His nether garment was of yellow nankeen, closely\\nfitted to the shape, and tied at his bunches of knees by large knots of\\nwhite ribbon, a good deal sullied by use. Clouded cotton stockings, and\\nshoes, on one of the latter of which was a plated spur, completed the\\ncostume of the lower extremity of this figure, no curve or angle of\\nwhich was concealed, but, on the other hand, studiously exhibited,\\nthrough the vanity or simplicity of its owner. From beneath the flap of\\nan enormous pocket of a soiled vest of embossed silk, heavily ornamented\\nwith tarnished silver lace, projected an instrument, which, from being\\nseen in such martial company, might have been easily mistaken for some\\nmischievous and unknown implement of war. Small as it was, this uncommon\\nengine had excited the curiosity of most of the Europeans in the camp,\\nthough several of the provincials were seen to handle it, not only\\nwithout fear, but with the utmost familiarity. A large, civil cocked\\nhat, like those worn by clergymen within the last thirty years,\\nsurmounted the whole, furnishing dignity to a good-natured and somewhat\\nvacant countenance, that apparently needed such artificial aid, to\\nsupport the gravity of some high and extraordinary trust.\\n\\nWhile the common herd stood aloof, in deference to the quarters of Webb,\\nthe figure we have described stalked in the centre of the domestics,\\nfreely expressing his censures or commendations on the merits of the\\nhorses, as by chance they displeased or satisfied his judgment.\\n\\n\"This beast, I rather conclude, friend, is not of home raising, but is\\nfrom foreign lands, or perhaps from the little island itself over the\\nblue water?\" he said, in a voice as remarkable for the softness and\\nsweetness of its tones, as was his person for its rare proportions: \"I\\nmay speak of these things, and be no braggart; for I have been down at\\nboth havens; that which is situate at the mouth of Thames, and is named\\nafter the capital of Old England, and that which is called \\'Haven,\\' with\\nthe addition of the word \\'New\\'; and have seen the snows and brigantines\\ncollecting their droves, like the gathering to the ark, being outward\\nbound to the Island of Jamaica, for the purpose of barter and traffic in\\nfour-footed animals; but never before have I beheld a beast which\\nverified the true Scripture war-horse like this: \\'He paweth in the\\nvalley, and rejoiceth in his strength: he goeth on to meet the armed\\nmen. He saith among the trumpets, Ha, ha; and he smelleth the battle\\nafar off, the thunder of the captains, and the shouting.\\' It would seem\\nthat the stock of the horse of Israel has descended to our own time;\\nwould it not, friend?\"\\n\\nReceiving no reply to this extraordinary appeal, which in truth, as it\\nwas delivered with the vigor of full and sonorous tones, merited some\\nsort of notice, he who had thus sung forth the language of the Holy Book\\nturned to the silent figure to whom he had unwittingly addressed\\nhimself, and found a new and more powerful subject of admiration in the\\nobject that encountered his gaze. His eyes fell on the still, upright,\\nand rigid form of the \"Indian runner,\" who had borne to the camp the\\nunwelcome tidings of the preceding evening. Although in a state of\\nperfect repose, and apparently disregarding, with characteristic\\nstoicism, the excitement and bustle around him, there was a sullen\\nfierceness mingled with the quiet of the savage, that was likely to\\narrest the attention of much more experienced eyes than those which now\\nscanned him, in unconcealed amazement. The native bore both the tomahawk\\nand knife of his tribe; and yet his appearance was not altogether that\\nof a warrior. On the contrary, there was an air of neglect about his\\nperson, like that which might have proceeded from great and recent\\nexertion, which he had not yet found leisure to repair. The colors of\\nthe war-paint had blended in dark confusion about his fierce\\ncountenance, and rendered his swarthy lineaments still more savage and\\nrepulsive than if art had attempted an effect which had been thus\\nproduced by chance. His eye, alone, which glistened like a fiery star\\namid lowering clouds, was to be seen in its state of native wildness.\\nFor a single instant, his searching and yet wary glance met the\\nwondering look of the other, and then changing its direction, partly in\\ncunning, and partly in disdain, it remained fixed, as if penetrating the\\ndistant air.\\n\\nIt is impossible to say what unlooked-for remark this short and silent\\ncommunication, between two such singular men, might have elicited from\\nthe white man, had not his active curiosity been again drawn to other\\nobjects. A general movement among the domestics, and a low sound of\\ngentle voices, announced the approach of those whose presence alone was\\nwanted to enable the cavalcade to move. The simple admirer of the\\nwar-horse instantly fell back to a low, gaunt, switch-tailed mare, that\\nwas unconsciously gleaning the faded herbage of the camp nigh by; where,\\nleaning with one elbow on the blanket that concealed an apology for a\\nsaddle, he became a spectator of the departure, while a foal was quietly\\nmaking its morning repast, on the opposite side of the same animal.\\n\\nA young man, in the dress of an officer, conducted to their steeds two\\nfemales, who, as it was apparent by their dresses, were prepared to\\nencounter the fatigues of a journey in the woods. One, and she was the\\nmost juvenile in her appearance, though both were young, permitted\\nglimpses of her dazzling complexion, fair golden hair, and bright blue\\neyes, to be caught, as she artlessly suffered the morning air to blow\\naside the green veil which descended low from her beaver. The flush\\nwhich still lingered above the pines in the western sky was not more\\nbright nor delicate than the bloom on her cheek; nor was the opening day\\nmore cheering than the animated smile which she bestowed on the youth,\\nas he assisted her into the saddle. The other, who appeared to share\\nequally in the attentions of the young officer, concealed her charms\\nfrom the gaze of the soldiery, with a care that seemed better fitted to\\nthe experience of four or five additional years. It could be seen,\\nhowever, that her person, though moulded with the same exquisite\\nproportions, of which none of the graces were lost by the travelling\\ndress she wore, was rather fuller and more mature than that of her\\ncompanion.\\n\\nNo sooner were these females seated, than their attendant sprang lightly\\ninto the saddle of the war-horse, when the whole three bowed to Webb,\\nwho, in courtesy, awaited their parting on the threshold of his cabin,\\nand turning their horses\\' heads, they proceeded at a slow amble,\\nfollowed by their train, towards the northern entrance of the\\nencampment. As they traversed that short distance, not a voice was\\nheard amongst them; but a slight exclamation proceeded from the younger\\nof the females, as the Indian runner glided by her, unexpectedly, and\\nled the way along the military road in her front. Though this sudden and\\nstartling movement of the Indian produced no sound from the other, in\\nthe surprise her veil also was allowed to open its folds, and betrayed\\nan indescribable look of pity, admiration, and horror, as her dark eye\\nfollowed the easy motions of the savage. The tresses of this lady were\\nshining and black, like the plumage of the raven. Her complexion was not\\nbrown, but it rather appeared charged with the color of the rich blood,\\nthat seemed ready to burst its bounds. And yet there was neither\\ncoarseness nor want of shadowing in a countenance that was exquisitely\\nregular and dignified, and surpassingly beautiful. She smiled, as if in\\npity at her own momentary forgetfulness, discovering by the act a row of\\nteeth that would have shamed the purest ivory; when, replacing the veil,\\nshe bowed her face, and rode in silence, like one whose thoughts were\\nabstracted from the scene around her.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \"Sola, sola, wo, ha, ho, sola!\"\\n\\n  SHAKESPEARE.\\n\\n\\nWhile one of the lovely beings we have so cursorily presented to the\\nreader was thus lost in thought, the other quickly recovered from the\\nalarm which induced the exclamation, and, laughing at her own weakness,\\nshe inquired of the youth who rode by her side,--\\n\\n\"Are such spectres frequent in the woods, Heyward; or is this sight an\\nespecial entertainment on our behalf? If the latter, gratitude must\\nclose our mouths; but if the former, both Cora and I shall have need to\\ndraw largely on that stock of hereditary courage which we boast, even\\nbefore we are made to encounter the redoubtable Montcalm.\"\\n\\n\"Yon Indian is a \\'runner\\' of the army; and, after the fashion of his\\npeople, he may be accounted a hero,\" returned the officer. \"He has\\nvolunteered to guide us to the lake, by a path but little known, sooner\\nthan if we followed the tardy movements of the column: and, by\\nconsequence, more agreeably.\"\\n\\n\"I like him not,\" said the lady, shuddering, partly in assumed, yet more\\nin real terror. \"You know him, Duncan, or you would not trust yourself\\nso freely to his keeping?\"\\n\\n\"Say, rather, Alice, that I would not trust you. I do know him, or he\\nwould not have my confidence, and least of all at this moment. He is\\nsaid to be a Canadian, too; and yet he served with our friends the\\nMohawks, who, as you know, are one of the six allied nations.[3] He was\\nbrought among us, as I have heard, by some strange accident in which\\nyour father was interested, and in which the savage was rigidly dealt\\nby--but I forget the idle tale; it is enough, that he is now our\\nfriend.\"\\n\\n\"If he has been my father\\'s enemy, I like him still less!\" exclaimed the\\nnow really anxious girl. \"Will you not speak to him, Major Heyward, that\\nI may hear his tones? Foolish though it may be, you have often heard me\\navow my faith in the tones of the human voice!\"\\n\\n\"It would be in vain; and answered, most probably, by an ejaculation.\\nThough he may understand it, he affects, like most of his people, to be\\nignorant of the English; and least of all will he condescend to speak\\nit, now that war demands the utmost exercise of his dignity. But he\\nstops; the private path by which we are to journey is, doubtless, at\\nhand.\"\\n\\nThe conjecture of Major Heyward was true. When they reached the spot\\nwhere the Indian stood, pointing into the thicket that fringed the\\nmilitary road, a narrow and blind path, which might, with some little\\ninconvenience, receive one person at a time, became visible.\\n\\n\"Here, then, lies our way,\" said the young man, in a low voice.\\n\"Manifest no distrust, or you may invite the danger you appear to\\napprehend.\"\\n\\n\"Cora, what think you?\" asked the reluctant fair one. \"If we journey\\nwith the troops, though we may find their presence irksome, shall we not\\nfeel better assurance of our safety?\"\\n\\n\"Being little accustomed to the practices of the savages, Alice, you\\nmistake the place of real danger,\" said Heyward. \"If enemies have\\nreached the portage at all, a thing by no means probable, as our scouts\\nare abroad, they will surely be found skirting the column where scalps\\nabound the most. The route of the detachment is known, while ours,\\nhaving been determined within the hour, must still be secret.\"\\n\\n\"Should we distrust the man because his manners are not our manners, and\\nthat his skin is dark?\" coldly asked Cora.\\n\\nAlice hesitated no longer; but giving her Narragansett[4] a smart cut\\nof the whip, she was the first to dash aside the slight branches of the\\nbushes, and to follow the runner along the dark and tangled pathway. The\\nyoung man regarded the last speaker in open admiration, and even\\npermitted her fairer though certainly not more beautiful companion to\\nproceed unattended, while he sedulously opened the way himself for the\\npassage of her who has been called Cora. It would seem that the\\ndomestics had been previously instructed; for, instead of penetrating\\nthe thicket, they followed the route of the column; a measure which\\nHeyward stated had been dictated by the sagacity of their guide, in\\norder to diminish the marks of their trail, if, haply, the Canadian\\nsavages should be lurking so far in advance of their army. For many\\nminutes the intricacy of the route admitted of no further dialogue;\\nafter which they emerged from the broad border of underbrush which grew\\nalong the line of the highway, and entered under the high but dark\\narches of the forest. Here their progress was less interrupted, and the\\ninstant the guide perceived that the females could command their steeds,\\nhe moved on, at a pace between a trot and a walk, and at a rate which\\nkept the sure-footed and peculiar animals they rode, at a fast yet easy\\namble. The youth had turned to speak to the dark-eyed Cora, when the\\ndistant sound of horses\\' hoofs, clattering over the roots of the broken\\nway in his rear, caused him to check his charger; and, as his companions\\ndrew their reins at the same instant, the whole party came to a halt, in\\norder to obtain an explanation of the unlooked-for interruption.\\n\\nIn a few moments a colt was seen gliding, like a fallow-deer, among the\\nstraight trunks of the pines; and, in another instant, the person of the\\nungainly man described in the preceding chapter, came into view, with as\\nmuch rapidity as he could excite his meagre beast to endure without\\ncoming to an open rupture. Until now this personage had escaped the\\nobservation of the travellers. If he possessed the power to arrest any\\nwandering eye when exhibiting the glories of his altitude on foot, his\\nequestrian graces were still more likely to attract attention.\\nNotwithstanding a constant application of his one armed heel to the\\nflanks of the mare, the most confirmed gait that he could establish was\\na Canterbury gallop with the hind legs, in which those more forward\\nassisted for doubtful moments, though generally content to maintain a\\nloping trot. Perhaps the rapidity of the changes from one of these paces\\nto the other created an optical illusion, which might thus magnify the\\npowers of the beast; for it is certain that Heyward, who possessed a\\ntrue eye for the merits of a horse, was unable, with his utmost\\ningenuity, to decide by what sort of movement his pursuer worked his\\nsinuous way on his footsteps with such persevering hardihood.\\n\\nThe industry and movements of the rider were not less remarkable than\\nthose of the ridden. At each change in the evolutions of the latter, the\\nformer raised his tall person in the stirrups; producing, in this\\nmanner, by the undue elongation of his legs, such sudden growths and\\ndiminishings of the stature, as baffled every conjecture that might be\\nmade as to his dimensions. If to this be added the fact that, in\\nconsequence of the ex parte application of the spur, one side of the\\nmare appeared to journey faster than the other; and that the aggrieved\\nflank was resolutely indicated by unremitted flourishes of a bushy tail,\\nwe finish the picture of both horse and man.\\n\\nThe frown which had gathered around the handsome, open, and manly brow\\nof Heyward, gradually relaxed, and his lips curled into a slight smile,\\nas he regarded the stranger. Alice made no very powerful effort to\\ncontrol her merriment; and even the dark, thoughtful eye of Cora lighted\\nwith a humor that, it would seem, the habit, rather than the nature of\\nits mistress repressed.\\n\\n\"Seek you any here?\" demanded Heyward, when the other had arrived\\nsufficiently nigh to abate his speed; \"I trust you are no messenger of\\nevil tidings?\"\\n\\n\"Even so,\" replied the stranger, making diligent use of his triangular\\ncastor, to produce a circulation in the close air of the woods, and\\nleaving his hearers in doubt to which of the young man\\'s questions he\\nresponded; when, however, he had cooled his face, and recovered his\\nbreath, he continued, \"I hear you are riding to William Henry; as I am\\njourneying thitherward myself, I concluded good company would seem\\nconsistent to the wishes of both parties.\"\\n\\n\"You appear to possess the privilege of a casting vote,\" returned\\nHeyward; \"we are three, whilst you have consulted no one but yourself.\"\\n\\n\"Even so. The first point to be obtained is to know one\\'s own mind. Once\\nsure of that, and where women are concerned, it is not easy, the next\\nis, to act up to the decision. I have endeavored to do both, and here I\\nam.\"\\n\\n\"If you journey to the lake, you have mistaken your route,\" said\\nHeyward, haughtily; \"the highway thither is at least half a mile behind\\nyou.\"\\n\\n\"Even so,\" returned the stranger, nothing daunted by this cold\\nreception; \"I have tarried at \\'Edward\\' a week, and I should be dumb not\\nto have inquired the road I was to journey; and if dumb there would be\\nan end to my calling.\" After simpering in a small way, like one whose\\nmodesty prohibited a more open expression of his admiration of a\\nwitticism that was perfectly unintelligible to his hearers, he\\ncontinued: \"It is not prudent for any one of my profession to be too\\nfamiliar with those he is to instruct; for which reason I follow not the\\nline of the army; besides which, I conclude that a gentleman of your\\ncharacter has the best judgment in matters of wayfaring; I have\\ntherefore decided to join company, in order that the ride may be made\\nagreeable, and partake of social communion.\"\\n\\n\"A most arbitrary, if not a hasty decision!\" exclaimed Heyward,\\nundecided whether to give vent to his growing anger, or to laugh in the\\nother\\'s face. \"But you speak of instruction, and of a profession; are\\nyou an adjunct to the provincial corps, as a master of the noble science\\nof defence and offence; or, perhaps, you are one who draws lines and\\nangles, under the pretence of expounding the mathematics?\"\\n\\nThe stranger regarded his interrogator a moment, in wonder; and then,\\nlosing every mark of self-satisfaction in an expression of solemn\\nhumility, he answered:--\\n\\n\"Of offence, I hope there is none, to either party: of defence, I make\\nnone--by God\\'s good mercy, having committed no palpable sin since last\\nentreating his pardoning grace. I understand not your allusions about\\nlines and angles; and I leave expounding to those who have been called\\nand set apart for that holy office. I lay claim to no higher gift than a\\nsmall insight into the glorious art of petitioning and thanksgiving, as\\npractised in psalmody.\"\\n\\n\"The man is, most manifestly, a disciple of Apollo,\" cried the amused\\nAlice, \"and I take him under my own especial protection. Nay, throw\\naside that frown, Heyward, and in pity to my longing ears, suffer him to\\njourney in our train. Besides,\" she added, in a low and hurried voice,\\ncasting a glance at the distant Cora, who slowly followed the footsteps\\nof their silent but sullen guide, \"it may be a friend added to our\\nstrength, in time of need.\"\\n\\n\"Think you, Alice, that I would trust those I love by this secret path,\\ndid I imagine such need could happen?\"\\n\\n\"Nay, nay, I think not of it now; but this strange man amuses me; and if\\nhe \\'hath music in his soul,\\' let us not churlishly reject his company.\"\\nShe pointed persuasively along the path with her riding-whip, while\\ntheir eyes met in a look which the young man lingered a moment to\\nprolong; then yielding to her gentle influence, he clapped his spurs\\ninto his charger, and in a few bounds was again at the side of Cora.\\n\\n\"I am glad to encounter thee, friend,\" continued the maiden, waving her\\nhand to the stranger to proceed, as she urged her Narragansett to renew\\nits amble. \"Partial relatives have almost persuaded me that I am not\\nentirely worthless in a duet myself; and we may enliven our wayfaring by\\nindulging in our favorite pursuit. It might be of signal advantage to\\none, ignorant as I, to hear the opinions and experience of a master in\\nthe art.\"\\n\\n\"It is refreshing both to the spirits and to the body to indulge in\\npsalmody, in befitting seasons,\" returned the master of song,\\nunhesitatingly complying with her intimation to follow; \"and nothing\\nwould relieve the mind more than such a consoling communion. But four\\nparts are altogether necessary to the perfection of melody. You have all\\nthe manifestations of a soft and rich treble; I can, by especial aid,\\ncarry a full tenor to the highest letter; but we lack counter and bass!\\nYon officer of the king, who hesitated to admit me to his company, might\\nfill the latter, if one may judge from the intonations of his voice in\\ncommon dialogue.\"\\n\\n\"Judge not too rashly from hasty and deceptive appearances,\" said the\\nlady, smiling; \"though Major Heyward can assume such deep notes on\\noccasion, believe me, his natural tones are better fitted for a mellow\\ntenor than the bass you heard.\"\\n\\n\"Is he, then, much practised in the art of psalmody?\" demanded her\\nsimple companion.\\n\\nAlice felt disposed to laugh, though she succeeded in suppressing her\\nmerriment, ere she answered,--\\n\\n\"I apprehend that he is rather addicted to profane song. The chances of\\na soldier\\'s life are but little fitted for the encouragement of more\\nsober inclinations.\"\\n\\n\"Man\\'s voice is given to him, like his other talents, to be used, and\\nnot to be abused. None can say they have ever known me neglect my gifts!\\nI am thankful that, though my boyhood may be said to have been set\\napart, like the youth of the royal David, for the purposes of music, no\\nsyllable of rude verse has ever profaned my lips.\"\\n\\n\"You have, then, limited your efforts to sacred song?\"\\n\\n\"Even so. As the psalms of David exceed all other language, so does the\\npsalmody that has been fitted to them by the divines and sages of the\\nland, surpass all vain poetry. Happily, I may say that I utter nothing\\nbut the thoughts and the wishes of the King of Israel himself; for\\nthough the times may call for some slight changes, yet does this version\\nwhich we use in the colonies of New England, so much exceed all other\\nversions, that, by its richness, its exactness, and its spiritual\\nsimplicity, it approacheth, as near as may be, to the great work of the\\ninspired writer. I never abide in any place, sleeping or waking, without\\nan example of this gifted work. \\'Tis the six-and-twentieth edition,\\npromulgated at Boston, Anno Domini 1744; and is entitled, _The Psalms,\\nHymns, and Spiritual Songs of the Old and New Testaments; faithfully\\ntranslated into English Metre, for the Use, Edification, and Comfort of\\nthe Saints, in Public and Private, especially in New England_.\"\\n\\nDuring this eulogium on the rare production of his native poets, the\\nstranger had drawn the book from his pocket, and, fitting a pair of\\niron-rimmed spectacles to his nose, opened the volume with a care and\\nveneration suited to its sacred purposes. Then, without circumlocution\\nor apology, first pronouncing the word \"Standish,\" and placing the\\nunknown engine, already described, to his mouth, from which he drew a\\nhigh, shrill sound, that was followed by an octave below, from his own\\nvoice, he commenced singing the following words, in full, sweet, and\\nmelodious tones, that set the music, the poetry, and even the uneasy\\nmotion of his ill-trained beast at defiance:--\\n\\n  \"How good it is, O see,\\n    And how it pleaseth well,\\n  Together, e\\'en in unity,\\n    For brethren so to dwell.\\n  It\\'s like the choice ointment,\\n    From the head to the beard did go:\\n  Down Aaron\\'s beard, that downward went,\\n    His garment\\'s skirts unto.\"\\n\\nThe delivery of these skilful rhymes was accompanied, on the part of the\\nstranger, by a regular rise and fall of his right hand, which\\nterminated at the descent, by suffering the fingers to dwell a moment on\\nthe leaves of the little volume; and on the ascent, by such a flourish\\nof the member as none but the initiated may ever hope to imitate. It\\nwould seem that long practice had rendered this manual accompaniment\\nnecessary; for it did not cease until the preposition which the poet had\\nselected for the close of his verse, had been duly delivered like a word\\nof two syllables.\\n\\nSuch an innovation on the silence and retirement of the forest could not\\nfail to enlist the ears of those who journeyed at so short a distance in\\nadvance. The Indian muttered a few words in broken English to Heyward,\\nwho, in his turn, spoke to the stranger; at once interrupting, and, for\\nthe time, closing his musical efforts.\\n\\n\"Though we are not in danger, common prudence would teach us to journey\\nthrough this wilderness in as quiet a manner as possible. You will,\\nthen, pardon me, Alice, should I diminish your enjoyments, by requesting\\nthis gentleman to postpone his chant until a safer opportunity.\"\\n\\n\"You will diminish them, indeed,\" returned the arch girl, \"for never did\\nI hear a more unworthy conjunction of execution and language, than that\\nto which I have been listening; and I was far gone in a learned inquiry\\ninto the causes of such an unfitness between sound and sense, when you\\nbroke the charm of my musings by that bass of yours, Duncan!\"\\n\\n\"I know not what you call my bass,\" said Heyward, piqued at her remark,\\n\"but I know that your safety, and that of Cora, is far dearer to me than\\ncould be any orchestra of Handel\\'s music.\" He paused and turned his head\\nquickly towards a thicket, and then bent his eyes suspiciously on their\\nguide, who continued his steady pace, in undisturbed gravity. The young\\nman smiled to himself, for he believed he had mistaken some shining\\nberry of the woods for the glistening eyeballs of a prowling savage, and\\nhe rode forward, continuing the conversation which had been interrupted\\nby the passing thought.\\n\\nMajor Heyward was mistaken only in suffering his youthful and generous\\npride to suppress his active watchfulness. The cavalcade had not long\\npassed, before the branches of the bushes that formed the thicket were\\ncautiously moved asunder, and a human visage, as fiercely wild as savage\\nart and unbridled passions could make it, peered out on the retiring\\nfootsteps of the travellers. A gleam of exultation shot across the\\ndarkly painted lineaments of the inhabitant of the forest, as he traced\\nthe route of his intended victims, who rode unconsciously onward; the\\nlight and graceful forms of the females waving among the trees, in the\\ncurvatures of their path, followed at each bend by the manly figure of\\nHeyward, until, finally, the shapeless person of the singing-master was\\nconcealed behind the numberless trunks of trees, that rose, in dark\\nlines, in the intermediate space.\\n\\n\\n\\n', 'chapter_summary': 'Before any characters appear, the time and geography are made clear. Though it is the last war that England and France waged for a country that neither would retain, the wilderness between the forces still has to be overcome first. Thus it is in 1757, in the New York area between the head waters of the Hudson River and Lake George to the north. Because only two years earlier General Braddock was disgracefully routed by a handful of French and Indians, the frontier is now exposed to real and imaginary savage disasters as well as to the horrors of warfare. Fear has replaced reason. Near dusk of a day in July, an Indian runner named Magua arrives at Fort Edward on the upper Hudson. He has come from Fort William Henry at the southern tip of Lake George with the news that the French General Montcalm is moving south with a very large army and that Munro, commander of Fort William Henry, is in urgent need of plentiful reinforcements from General Webb. Early the next morning, a limited detachment of fifteen hundred regulars and colonists departs as if swallowed by the forest. Shortly afterwards, Major Duncan Heyward and Alice and Cora Munro, guided by Magua on foot, take by horseback a secret route toward William Henry for the girls to join their father. Blonde Alice is doubtful about Magua, covered with war paint and showing a sullen fierceness; but dark-haired Cora is stoically common sense about him, even though Heyward mentions that their father had once had to deal rigidly with the Indian. As the small party pushes on, they are overtaken by David Gamut, a tall, ungainly psalmodist ridiculously dressed and carrying a pitch pipe while riding a mare followed by its young colt. He desires to join them, and after some banter between him and Alice, he pulls out the twenty-sixth edition of The Bay Psalm Book, sounds his pipe, and renders a song \"in full, sweet, and melodious tones.\" At a muttered comment from Magua, Heyward insists upon silence for safety. Then he glances about them and, satisfied that he has seen only shining berries, smiles to himself as they move on. But he is wrong. The branches move and a man peers exultingly after them as they disappear among the dark lines of trees.'}\n"

In doing so I will keep to the order indicated above,\\nand discuss how such principalities are to be ruled and preserved.\\n\\nI say at once there are fewer difficulties in holding hereditary states,\\nand those long accustomed to the family of their prince, than new\\nones; for it is sufficient only not to transgress the customs of his\\nancestors, and to deal prudently with circumstances as they arise, for a\\nprince of average powers to maintain himself in his state, unless he\\nbe deprived of it by some extraordinary and excessive force; and if he\\nshould be so deprived of it, whenever anything sinister happens to the\\nusurper, he will regain it.\\n\\nWe have in Italy, for example, the Duke of Ferrara, who could not have\\nwithstood the attacks of the Venetians in \\'84, nor those of Pope Julius\\nin \\'10, unless he had been long established in his dominions. For the\\nhereditary prince has less cause and less necessity to offend; hence it\\nhappens that he will be more loved; and unless extraordinary vices cause\\nhim to be hated, it is reasonable to expect that his subjects will be\\nnaturally well disposed towards him; and in the antiquity and duration\\nof his rule the memories and motives that make for change are lost, for\\none change always leaves the toothing for another.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBut the difficulties occur in a new principality. And firstly, if it be\\nnot entirely new, but is, as it were, a member of a state which, taken\\ncollectively, may be called composite, the changes arise chiefly from\\nan inherent difficulty which there is in all new principalities; for\\nmen change their rulers willingly, hoping to better themselves, and this\\nhope induces them to take up arms against him who rules: wherein they\\nare deceived, because they afterwards find by experience they have\\ngone from bad to worse. This follows also on another natural and common\\nnecessity, which always causes a new prince to burden those who have\\nsubmitted to him with his soldiery and with infinite other hardships\\nwhich he must put upon his new acquisition.\\n\\nIn this way you have enemies in all those whom you have injured in\\nseizing that principality, and you are not able to keep those friends\\nwho put you there because of your not being able to satisfy them in the\\nway they expected, and you cannot take strong measures against them,\\nfeeling bound to them. For, although one may be very strong in armed\\nforces, yet in entering a province one has always need of the goodwill\\nof the natives.\\n\\nFor these reasons Louis the Twelfth, King of France, quickly occupied\\nMilan, and as quickly lost it; and to turn him out the first time it\\nonly needed Lodovico\\'s own forces; because those who had opened the\\ngates to him, finding themselves deceived in their hopes of future\\nbenefit, would not endure the ill-treatment of the new prince. It is\\nvery true that, after acquiring rebellious provinces a second time,\\nthey are not so lightly lost afterwards, because the prince, with\\nlittle reluctance, takes the opportunity of the rebellion to punish the\\ndelinquents, to clear out the suspects, and to strengthen himself in the\\nweakest places. Thus to cause France to lose Milan the first time it was\\nenough for the Duke Lodovico(*) to raise insurrections on the borders;\\nbut to cause him to lose it a second time it was necessary to bring\\nthe whole world against him, and that his armies should be defeated and\\ndriven out of Italy; which followed from the causes above mentioned.\\n\\n     (*) Duke Lodovico was Lodovico Moro, a son of Francesco\\n     Sforza, who married Beatrice d\\'Este. He ruled over Milan\\n     from 1494 to 1500, and died in 1510.\\n\\nNevertheless Milan was taken from France both the first and the second\\ntime. The general reasons for the first have been discussed; it remains\\nto name those for the second, and to see what resources he had, and what\\nany one in his situation would have had for maintaining himself more\\nsecurely in his acquisition than did the King of France.\\n\\nNow I say that those dominions which, when acquired, are added to an\\nancient state by him who acquires them, are either of the same country\\nand language, or they are not. When they are, it is easier to hold them,\\nespecially when they have not been accustomed to self-government; and\\nto hold them securely it is enough to have destroyed the family of the\\nprince who was ruling them; because the two peoples, preserving in other\\nthings the old conditions, and not being unlike in customs, will live\\nquietly together, as one has seen in Brittany, Burgundy, Gascony, and\\nNormandy, which have been bound to France for so long a time: and,\\nalthough there may be some difference in language, nevertheless the\\ncustoms are alike, and the people will easily be able to get on amongst\\nthemselves. He who has annexed them, if he wishes to hold them, has only\\nto bear in mind two considerations: the one, that the family of their\\nformer lord is extinguished; the other, that neither their laws nor\\ntheir taxes are altered, so that in a very short time they will become\\nentirely one body with the old principality.\\n\\nBut when states are acquired in a country differing in language,\\ncustoms, or laws, there are difficulties, and good fortune and great\\nenergy are needed to hold them, and one of the greatest and most real\\nhelps would be that he who has acquired them should go and reside there.\\nThis would make his position more secure and durable, as it has made\\nthat of the Turk in Greece, who, notwithstanding all the other measures\\ntaken by him for holding that state, if he had not settled there, would\\nnot have been able to keep it. Because, if one is on the spot, disorders\\nare seen as they spring up, and one can quickly remedy them; but if one\\nis not at hand, they are heard of only when they are great, and then one\\ncan no longer remedy them. Besides this, the country is not pillaged\\nby your officials; the subjects are satisfied by prompt recourse to the\\nprince; thus, wishing to be good, they have more cause to love him, and\\nwishing to be otherwise, to fear him. He who would attack that state\\nfrom the outside must have the utmost caution; as long as the prince\\nresides there it can only be wrested from him with the greatest\\ndifficulty.\\n\\nThe other and better course is to send colonies to one or two places,\\nwhich may be as keys to that state, for it is necessary either to do\\nthis or else to keep there a great number of cavalry and infantry. A\\nprince does not spend much on colonies, for with little or no expense he\\ncan send them out and keep them there, and he offends a minority only of\\nthe citizens from whom he takes lands and houses to give them to the new\\ninhabitants; and those whom he offends, remaining poor and scattered,\\nare never able to injure him; whilst the rest being uninjured are easily\\nkept quiet, and at the same time are anxious not to err for fear it\\nshould happen to them as it has to those who have been despoiled. In\\nconclusion, I say that these colonies are not costly, they are more\\nfaithful, they injure less, and the injured, as has been said, being\\npoor and scattered, cannot hurt. Upon this, one has to remark that men\\nought either to be well treated or crushed, because they can avenge\\nthemselves of lighter injuries, of more serious ones they cannot;\\ntherefore the injury that is to be done to a man ought to be of such a\\nkind that one does not stand in fear of revenge.\\n\\nBut in maintaining armed men there in place of colonies one spends much\\nmore, having to consume on the garrison all the income from the\\nstate, so that the acquisition turns into a loss, and many more are\\nexasperated, because the whole state is injured; through the shifting\\nof the garrison up and down all become acquainted with hardship, and\\nall become hostile, and they are enemies who, whilst beaten on their\\nown ground, are yet able to do hurt. For every reason, therefore, such\\nguards are as useless as a colony is useful.\\n\\nAgain, the prince who holds a country differing in the above respects\\nought to make himself the head and defender of his less powerful\\nneighbours, and to weaken the more powerful amongst them, taking care\\nthat no foreigner as powerful as himself shall, by any accident, get\\na footing there; for it will always happen that such a one will be\\nintroduced by those who are discontented, either through excess of\\nambition or through fear, as one has seen already. The Romans were\\nbrought into Greece by the Aetolians; and in every other country where\\nthey obtained a footing they were brought in by the inhabitants. And the\\nusual course of affairs is that, as soon as a powerful foreigner enters\\na country, all the subject states are drawn to him, moved by the hatred\\nwhich they feel against the ruling power. So that in respect to those\\nsubject states he has not to take any trouble to gain them over to\\nhimself, for the whole of them quickly rally to the state which he has\\nacquired there. He has only to take care that they do not get hold of\\ntoo much power and too much authority, and then with his own forces, and\\nwith their goodwill, he can easily keep down the more powerful of them,\\nso as to remain entirely master in the country. And he who does not\\nproperly manage this business will soon lose what he has acquired, and\\nwhilst he does hold it he will have endless difficulties and troubles.\\n\\nThe Romans, in the countries which they annexed, observed closely these\\nmeasures; they sent colonies and maintained friendly relations with(*)\\nthe minor powers, without increasing their strength; they kept down the\\ngreater, and did not allow any strong foreign powers to gain authority.\\nGreece appears to me sufficient for an example. The Achaeans and\\nAetolians were kept friendly by them, the kingdom of Macedonia was\\nhumbled, Antiochus was driven out; yet the merits of the Achaeans and\\nAetolians never secured for them permission to increase their power, nor\\ndid the persuasions of Philip ever induce the Romans to be his friends\\nwithout first humbling him, nor did the influence of Antiochus make them\\nagree that he should retain any lordship over the country. Because the\\nRomans did in these instances what all prudent princes ought to do,\\nwho have to regard not only present troubles, but also future ones, for\\nwhich they must prepare with every energy, because, when foreseen, it is\\neasy to remedy them; but if you wait until they approach, the medicine\\nis no longer in time because the malady has become incurable; for it\\nhappens in this, as the physicians say it happens in hectic fever,\\nthat in the beginning of the malady it is easy to cure but difficult to\\ndetect, but in the course of time, not having been either detected or\\ntreated in the beginning, it becomes easy to detect but difficult to\\ncure. Thus it happens in affairs of state, for when the evils that arise\\nhave been foreseen (which it is only given to a wise man to see), they\\ncan be quickly redressed, but when, through not having been foreseen,\\nthey have been permitted to grow in a way that every one can see them,\\nthere is no longer a remedy. Therefore, the Romans, foreseeing troubles,\\ndealt with them at once, and, even to avoid a war, would not let them\\ncome to a head, for they knew that war is not to be avoided, but is only\\nto be put off to the advantage of others; moreover they wished to fight\\nwith Philip and Antiochus in Greece so as not to have to do it in Italy;\\nthey could have avoided both, but this they did not wish; nor did that\\never please them which is forever in the mouths of the wise ones of our\\ntime:--Let us enjoy the benefits of the time--but rather the benefits of\\ntheir own valour and prudence, for time drives everything before it, and\\nis able to bring with it good as well as evil, and evil as well as good.\\n\\n     (*) See remark in the introduction on the word\\n     \"intrattenere.\"\\n\\nBut let us turn to France and inquire whether she has done any of the\\nthings mentioned. I will speak of Louis(*) (and not of Charles)(+) as\\nthe one whose conduct is the better to be observed, he having held\\npossession of Italy for the longest period; and you will see that he\\nhas done the opposite to those things which ought to be done to retain a\\nstate composed of divers elements.\\n\\n     (*) Louis XII, King of France, \"The Father of the People,\"\\n     born 1462, died 1515.\\n\\n     (+) Charles VIII, King of France, born 1470, died 1498.\\n\\nKing Louis was brought into Italy by the ambition of the Venetians, who\\ndesired to obtain half the state of Lombardy by his intervention. I\\nwill not blame the course taken by the king, because, wishing to get a\\nfoothold in Italy, and having no friends there--seeing rather that every\\ndoor was shut to him owing to the conduct of Charles--he was forced to\\naccept those friendships which he could get, and he would have succeeded\\nvery quickly in his design if in other matters he had not made some\\nmistakes. The king, however, having acquired Lombardy, regained at once\\nthe authority which Charles had lost: Genoa yielded; the Florentines\\nbecame his friends; the Marquess of Mantua, the Duke of Ferrara, the\\nBentivogli, my lady of Forli, the Lords of Faenza, of Pesaro, of\\nRimini, of Camerino, of Piombino, the Lucchese, the Pisans, the\\nSienese--everybody made advances to him to become his friend. Then could\\nthe Venetians realize the rashness of the course taken by them, which,\\nin order that they might secure two towns in Lombardy, had made the king\\nmaster of two-thirds of Italy.\\n\\nLet any one now consider with what little difficulty the king could have\\nmaintained his position in Italy had he observed the rules above laid\\ndown, and kept all his friends secure and protected; for although they\\nwere numerous they were both weak and timid, some afraid of the Church,\\nsome of the Venetians, and thus they would always have been forced to\\nstand in with him, and by their means he could easily have made himself\\nsecure against those who remained powerful. But he was no sooner in\\nMilan than he did the contrary by assisting Pope Alexander to occupy the\\nRomagna. It never occurred to him that by this action he was weakening\\nhimself, depriving himself of friends and of those who had thrown\\nthemselves into his lap, whilst he aggrandized the Church by adding much\\ntemporal power to the spiritual, thus giving it greater authority. And\\nhaving committed this prime error, he was obliged to follow it up, so\\nmuch so that, to put an end to the ambition of Alexander, and to prevent\\nhis becoming the master of Tuscany, he was himself forced to come into\\nItaly.\\n\\nAnd as if it were not enough to have aggrandized the Church, and\\ndeprived himself of friends, he, wishing to have the kingdom of Naples,\\ndivided it with the King of Spain, and where he was the prime arbiter in\\nItaly he takes an associate, so that the ambitious of that country and\\nthe malcontents of his own should have somewhere to shelter; and whereas\\nhe could have left in the kingdom his own pensioner as king, he drove\\nhim out, to put one there who was able to drive him, Louis, out in turn.\\n\\nThe wish to acquire is in truth very natural and common, and men always\\ndo so when they can, and for this they will be praised not blamed; but\\nwhen they cannot do so, yet wish to do so by any means, then there is\\nfolly and blame. Therefore, if France could have attacked Naples with\\nher own forces she ought to have done so; if she could not, then she\\nought not to have divided it. And if the partition which she made with\\nthe Venetians in Lombardy was justified by the excuse that by it she got\\na foothold in Italy, this other partition merited blame, for it had not\\nthe excuse of that necessity.\\n\\nTherefore Louis made these five errors: he destroyed the minor powers,\\nhe increased the strength of one of the greater powers in Italy, he\\nbrought in a foreign power, he did not settle in the country, he did not\\nsend colonies. Which errors, had he lived, were not enough to injure\\nhim had he not made a sixth by taking away their dominions from the\\nVenetians; because, had he not aggrandized the Church, nor brought Spain\\ninto Italy, it would have been very reasonable and necessary to humble\\nthem; but having first taken these steps, he ought never to have\\nconsented to their ruin, for they, being powerful, would always have\\nkept off others from designs on Lombardy, to which the Venetians would\\nnever have consented except to become masters themselves there; also\\nbecause the others would not wish to take Lombardy from France in order\\nto give it to the Venetians, and to run counter to both they would not\\nhave had the courage.\\n\\nAnd if any one should say: \"King Louis yielded the Romagna to Alexander\\nand the kingdom to Spain to avoid war,\" I answer for the reasons given\\nabove that a blunder ought never to be perpetrated to avoid war, because\\nit is not to be avoided, but is only deferred to your disadvantage. And\\nif another should allege the pledge which the king had given to the\\nPope that he would assist him in the enterprise, in exchange for the\\ndissolution of his marriage(*) and for the cap to Rouen,(+) to that I\\nreply what I shall write later on concerning the faith of princes, and\\nhow it ought to be kept.\\n\\n     (*) Louis XII divorced his wife, Jeanne, daughter of Louis\\n     XI, and married in 1499 Anne of Brittany, widow of Charles\\n     VIII, in order to retain the Duchy of Brittany for the\\n     crown.\\n\\n     (+) The Archbishop of Rouen. He was Georges d\\'Amboise,\\n     created a cardinal by Alexander VI. Born 1460, died 1510.\\n\\nThus King Louis lost Lombardy by not having followed any of the\\nconditions observed by those who have taken possession of countries and\\nwished to retain them. Nor is there any miracle in this, but much that\\nis reasonable and quite natural. And on these matters I spoke at Nantes\\nwith Rouen, when Valentino, as Cesare Borgia, the son of Pope Alexander,\\nwas usually called, occupied the Romagna, and on Cardinal Rouen\\nobserving to me that the Italians did not understand war, I replied\\nto him that the French did not understand statecraft, meaning that\\notherwise they would not have allowed the Church to reach such\\ngreatness. And in fact it has been seen that the greatness of the Church\\nand of Spain in Italy has been caused by France, and her ruin may be\\nattributed to them. From this a general rule is drawn which never or\\nrarely fails: that he who is the cause of another becoming powerful\\nis ruined; because that predominancy has been brought about either by\\nastuteness or else by force, and both are distrusted by him who has been\\nraised to power.\\n\\n\\n\\n', 'chapter_summary': 'Machiavelli prefaces The Prince with a letter to \"the Magnificent Lorenzo de Medici.\" In fact, the first edition of The Prince was dedicated to Guiliano de Medici, son of Lorenzo the Magnificent. Guiliano died in 1516, and so Machiavelli rededicated the book to one of Lorenzo\\'s grandsons, the Duke of Urbino, who was also named Lorenzo. The opening letter is abstract enough to allow for these changes: Machiavelli admits that he is seeking favor with \"a prince\" and is offering his book as a gift. \"I...would like to commend myself to your Magnificence with some token of my readiness to serve you,\" he writes. In the first chapter, entitled \"Different Kinds of States, and the Different Ways to Get Them,\" Machiavelli proceeds to map out a classification of states. In short, we have princely states and republics. Princely states are either hereditary or new. The new states are either brand new or freshly joined to an established hereditary state. Of the latter, the conquered territories are accustomed to either living free or living under a prince. The second chapter focuses on hereditary principates. These are easier to rule than new states, as tradition provides a basis for stable government. Machiavelli argues a key point here in regards to a people\\'s desire for change: \"And in the antiquity and continuity of the government,\" he writes, \"people forget not only the reasons for innovations but their very existence, because every new change provides a footing to build on another.\" Chapter III, \"On Mixed Principalities,\" is a longer, more involved consideration of the problematic states: those states that are new and are \"like a graft freshly joined to an old kingdom .\" What we have here is, simply put, the conquest of territory. Machiavelli meditates on what exactly makes such a conquest successful, using two prime examples: the Roman Empire, which succeeded, and King Louis of France, who failed. What did the Romans do correctly? According to Machiavelli, they sent out colonies, a far better strategy than the use of standing armies . The Romans also indulged the less powerful, broke the more powerful, and didn\\'t allow foreigners to gain a stronghold. Never did they let a trouble remain just to avoid going to war over it. As Machiavelli argues, war is never entirely avoidable, but is merely postponed; one should therefore fight it sooner rather than later, attacking those ills that plague a society before they become incurable. Preemption, in other words, is the name of the game. On the subject of colonies, Machiavelli goes one step further, noting that it is better to displace or disrupt the poor and powerless than the rich and powerful. Why? Because the poor cannot fight back. Moreover, \"men ought either to be caressed or destroyed, since they will seek revenge for minor hurts but will not be able to revenge major ones.\" Turning to King Louis, Machiavelli lists his mistakes in an effort to explain his failure to conquer Italian states. Louis entered Italy through the ambition of the Venetians, who wanted to gain control of half of Lombardy. Granted this opportunity, Louis proceeded to squander it. He put down the weaker powers , increased the strength of a major power , introduced a powerful foreigner into the fray , never took up residence in Italy, never set up colonies, and deprived the Venetians of their power. This last error proved fatal: if the Venetians had retained full power, no one would have taken Lombardy from France just to give it to Venice, and the Venetians would not have let others in.'}\n"

Implacable November weather. As much mud in\\nthe streets as if the waters had but newly retired from the face of\\nthe earth, and it would not be wonderful to meet a Megalosaurus,\\nforty feet long or so, waddling like an elephantine lizard up Holborn\\nHill. Smoke lowering down from chimney-pots, making a soft black\\ndrizzle, with flakes of soot in it as big as full-grown\\nsnowflakes--gone into mourning, one might imagine, for the death of\\nthe sun. Dogs, undistinguishable in mire. Horses, scarcely better;\\nsplashed to their very blinkers. Foot passengers, jostling one\\nanother\\'s umbrellas in a general infection of ill temper, and losing\\ntheir foot-hold at street-corners, where tens of thousands of other\\nfoot passengers have been slipping and sliding since the day broke\\n(if this day ever broke), adding new deposits to the crust upon crust\\nof mud, sticking at those points tenaciously to the pavement, and\\naccumulating at compound interest.\\n\\nFog everywhere. Fog up the river, where it flows among green aits and\\nmeadows; fog down the river, where it rolls defiled among the tiers\\nof shipping and the waterside pollutions of a great (and dirty) city.\\nFog on the Essex marshes, fog on the Kentish heights. Fog creeping\\ninto the cabooses of collier-brigs; fog lying out on the yards and\\nhovering in the rigging of great ships; fog drooping on the gunwales\\nof barges and small boats. Fog in the eyes and throats of ancient\\nGreenwich pensioners, wheezing by the firesides of their wards; fog\\nin the stem and bowl of the afternoon pipe of the wrathful skipper,\\ndown in his close cabin; fog cruelly pinching the toes and fingers of\\nhis shivering little \\'prentice boy on deck. Chance people on the\\nbridges peeping over the parapets into a nether sky of fog, with fog\\nall round them, as if they were up in a balloon and hanging in the\\nmisty clouds.\\n\\nGas looming through the fog in divers places in the streets, much as\\nthe sun may, from the spongey fields, be seen to loom by husbandman\\nand ploughboy. Most of the shops lighted two hours before their\\ntime--as the gas seems to know, for it has a haggard and unwilling\\nlook.\\n\\nThe raw afternoon is rawest, and the dense fog is densest, and the\\nmuddy streets are muddiest near that leaden-headed old obstruction,\\nappropriate ornament for the threshold of a leaden-headed old\\ncorporation, Temple Bar. And hard by Temple Bar, in Lincoln\\'s Inn\\nHall, at the very heart of the fog, sits the Lord High Chancellor in\\nhis High Court of Chancery.\\n\\nNever can there come fog too thick, never can there come mud and mire\\ntoo deep, to assort with the groping and floundering condition which\\nthis High Court of Chancery, most pestilent of hoary sinners, holds\\nthis day in the sight of heaven and earth.\\n\\nOn such an afternoon, if ever, the Lord High Chancellor ought to be\\nsitting here--as here he is--with a foggy glory round his head,\\nsoftly fenced in with crimson cloth and curtains, addressed by a\\nlarge advocate with great whiskers, a little voice, and an\\ninterminable brief, and outwardly directing his contemplation to the\\nlantern in the roof, where he can see nothing but fog. On such an\\nafternoon some score of members of the High Court of Chancery bar\\nought to be--as here they are--mistily engaged in one of the ten\\nthousand stages of an endless cause, tripping one another up on\\nslippery precedents, groping knee-deep in technicalities, running\\ntheir goat-hair and horsehair warded heads against walls of words and\\nmaking a pretence of equity with serious faces, as players might. On\\nsuch an afternoon the various solicitors in the cause, some two or\\nthree of whom have inherited it from their fathers, who made a\\nfortune by it, ought to be--as are they not?--ranged in a line, in a\\nlong matted well (but you might look in vain for truth at the bottom\\nof it) between the registrar\\'s red table and the silk gowns, with\\nbills, cross-bills, answers, rejoinders, injunctions, affidavits,\\nissues, references to masters, masters\\' reports, mountains of costly\\nnonsense, piled before them. Well may the court be dim, with wasting\\ncandles here and there; well may the fog hang heavy in it, as if it\\nwould never get out; well may the stained-glass windows lose their\\ncolour and admit no light of day into the place; well may the\\nuninitiated from the streets, who peep in through the glass panes in\\nthe door, be deterred from entrance by its owlish aspect and by the\\ndrawl, languidly echoing to the roof from the padded dais where the\\nLord High Chancellor looks into the lantern that has no light in it\\nand where the attendant wigs are all stuck in a fog-bank! This is the\\nCourt of Chancery, which has its decaying houses and its blighted\\nlands in every shire, which has its worn-out lunatic in every\\nmadhouse and its dead in every churchyard, which has its ruined\\nsuitor with his slipshod heels and threadbare dress borrowing and\\nbegging through the round of every man\\'s acquaintance, which gives to\\nmonied might the means abundantly of wearying out the right, which so\\nexhausts finances, patience, courage, hope, so overthrows the brain\\nand breaks the heart, that there is not an honourable man among its\\npractitioners who would not give--who does not often give--the\\nwarning, \"Suffer any wrong that can be done you rather than come\\nhere!\"\\n\\nWho happen to be in the Lord Chancellor\\'s court this murky afternoon\\nbesides the Lord Chancellor, the counsel in the cause, two or three\\ncounsel who are never in any cause, and the well of solicitors before\\nmentioned? There is the registrar below the judge, in wig and gown;\\nand there are two or three maces, or petty-bags, or privy purses, or\\nwhatever they may be, in legal court suits. These are all yawning,\\nfor no crumb of amusement ever falls from Jarndyce and Jarndyce (the\\ncause in hand), which was squeezed dry years upon years ago. The\\nshort-hand writers, the reporters of the court, and the reporters of\\nthe newspapers invariably decamp with the rest of the regulars when\\nJarndyce and Jarndyce comes on. Their places are a blank. Standing on\\na seat at the side of the hall, the better to peer into the curtained\\nsanctuary, is a little mad old woman in a squeezed bonnet who is\\nalways in court, from its sitting to its rising, and always expecting\\nsome incomprehensible judgment to be given in her favour. Some say\\nshe really is, or was, a party to a suit, but no one knows for\\ncertain because no one cares. She carries some small litter in a\\nreticule which she calls her documents, principally consisting of\\npaper matches and dry lavender. A sallow prisoner has come up, in\\ncustody, for the half-dozenth time to make a personal application \"to\\npurge himself of his contempt,\" which, being a solitary surviving\\nexecutor who has fallen into a state of conglomeration about accounts\\nof which it is not pretended that he had ever any knowledge, he is\\nnot at all likely ever to do. In the meantime his prospects in life\\nare ended. Another ruined suitor, who periodically appears from\\nShropshire and breaks out into efforts to address the Chancellor at\\nthe close of the day\\'s business and who can by no means be made to\\nunderstand that the Chancellor is legally ignorant of his existence\\nafter making it desolate for a quarter of a century, plants himself\\nin a good place and keeps an eye on the judge, ready to call out \"My\\nLord!\" in a voice of sonorous complaint on the instant of his rising.\\nA few lawyers\\' clerks and others who know this suitor by sight linger\\non the chance of his furnishing some fun and enlivening the dismal\\nweather a little.\\n\\nJarndyce and Jarndyce drones on. This scarecrow of a suit has, in\\ncourse of time, become so complicated that no man alive knows what it\\nmeans. The parties to it understand it least, but it has been\\nobserved that no two Chancery lawyers can talk about it for five\\nminutes without coming to a total disagreement as to all the\\npremises. Innumerable children have been born into the cause;\\ninnumerable young people have married into it; innumerable old people\\nhave died out of it. Scores of persons have deliriously found\\nthemselves made parties in Jarndyce and Jarndyce without knowing how\\nor why; whole families have inherited legendary hatreds with the\\nsuit. The little plaintiff or defendant who was promised a new\\nrocking-horse when Jarndyce and Jarndyce should be settled has grown\\nup, possessed himself of a real horse, and trotted away into the\\nother world. Fair wards of court have faded into mothers and\\ngrandmothers; a long procession of Chancellors has come in and gone\\nout; the legion of bills in the suit have been transformed into mere\\nbills of mortality; there are not three Jarndyces left upon the earth\\nperhaps since old Tom Jarndyce in despair blew his brains out at a\\ncoffee-house in Chancery Lane; but Jarndyce and Jarndyce still drags\\nits dreary length before the court, perennially hopeless.\\n\\nJarndyce and Jarndyce has passed into a joke. That is the only good\\nthat has ever come of it. It has been death to many, but it is a joke\\nin the profession. Every master in Chancery has had a reference out\\nof it. Every Chancellor was \"in it,\" for somebody or other, when he\\nwas counsel at the bar. Good things have been said about it by\\nblue-nosed, bulbous-shoed old benchers in select port-wine committee\\nafter dinner in hall. Articled clerks have been in the habit of\\nfleshing their legal wit upon it. The last Lord Chancellor handled it\\nneatly, when, correcting Mr. Blowers, the eminent silk gown who said\\nthat such a thing might happen when the sky rained potatoes, he\\nobserved, \"or when we get through Jarndyce and Jarndyce, Mr.\\nBlowers\"--a pleasantry that particularly tickled the maces, bags, and\\npurses.\\n\\nHow many people out of the suit Jarndyce and Jarndyce has stretched\\nforth its unwholesome hand to spoil and corrupt would be a very wide\\nquestion. From the master upon whose impaling files reams of dusty\\nwarrants in Jarndyce and Jarndyce have grimly writhed into many\\nshapes, down to the copying-clerk in the Six Clerks\\' Office who has\\ncopied his tens of thousands of Chancery folio-pages under that\\neternal heading, no man\\'s nature has been made better by it. In\\ntrickery, evasion, procrastination, spoliation, botheration, under\\nfalse pretences of all sorts, there are influences that can never\\ncome to good. The very solicitors\\' boys who have kept the wretched\\nsuitors at bay, by protesting time out of mind that Mr. Chizzle,\\nMizzle, or otherwise was particularly engaged and had appointments\\nuntil dinner, may have got an extra moral twist and shuffle into\\nthemselves out of Jarndyce and Jarndyce. The receiver in the cause\\nhas acquired a goodly sum of money by it but has acquired too a\\ndistrust of his own mother and a contempt for his own kind. Chizzle,\\nMizzle, and otherwise have lapsed into a habit of vaguely promising\\nthemselves that they will look into that outstanding little matter\\nand see what can be done for Drizzle--who was not well used--when\\nJarndyce and Jarndyce shall be got out of the office. Shirking and\\nsharking in all their many varieties have been sown broadcast by the\\nill-fated cause; and even those who have contemplated its history\\nfrom the outermost circle of such evil have been insensibly tempted\\ninto a loose way of letting bad things alone to take their own bad\\ncourse, and a loose belief that if the world go wrong it was in some\\noff-hand manner never meant to go right.\\n\\nThus, in the midst of the mud and at the heart of the fog, sits the\\nLord High Chancellor in his High Court of Chancery.\\n\\n\"Mr. Tangle,\" says the Lord High Chancellor, latterly something\\nrestless under the eloquence of that learned gentleman.\\n\\n\"Mlud,\" says Mr. Tangle. Mr. Tangle knows more of Jarndyce and\\nJarndyce than anybody. He is famous for it--supposed never to have\\nread anything else since he left school.\\n\\n\"Have you nearly concluded your argument?\"\\n\\n\"Mlud, no--variety of points--feel it my duty tsubmit--ludship,\" is\\nthe reply that slides out of Mr. Tangle.\\n\\n\"Several members of the bar are still to be heard, I believe?\" says\\nthe Chancellor with a slight smile.\\n\\nEighteen of Mr. Tangle\\'s learned friends, each armed with a little\\nsummary of eighteen hundred sheets, bob up like eighteen hammers in a\\npianoforte, make eighteen bows, and drop into their eighteen places\\nof obscurity.\\n\\n\"We will proceed with the hearing on Wednesday fortnight,\" says the\\nChancellor. For the question at issue is only a question of costs, a\\nmere bud on the forest tree of the parent suit, and really will come\\nto a settlement one of these days.\\n\\nThe Chancellor rises; the bar rises; the prisoner is brought forward\\nin a hurry; the man from Shropshire cries, \"My lord!\" Maces, bags,\\nand purses indignantly proclaim silence and frown at the man from\\nShropshire.\\n\\n\"In reference,\" proceeds the Chancellor, still on Jarndyce and\\nJarndyce, \"to the young girl--\"\\n\\n\"Begludship\\'s pardon--boy,\" says Mr. Tangle prematurely. \"In\\nreference,\" proceeds the Chancellor with extra distinctness, \"to the\\nyoung girl and boy, the two young people\"--Mr. Tangle crushed--\"whom\\nI directed to be in attendance to-day and who are now in my private\\nroom, I will see them and satisfy myself as to the expediency of\\nmaking the order for their residing with their uncle.\"\\n\\nMr. Tangle on his legs again. \"Begludship\\'s pardon--dead.\"\\n\\n\"With their\"--Chancellor looking through his double eye-glass at the\\npapers on his desk--\"grandfather.\"\\n\\n\"Begludship\\'s pardon--victim of rash action--brains.\"\\n\\nSuddenly a very little counsel with a terrific bass voice arises,\\nfully inflated, in the back settlements of the fog, and says, \"Will\\nyour lordship allow me? I appear for him. He is a cousin, several\\ntimes removed. I am not at the moment prepared to inform the court in\\nwhat exact remove he is a cousin, but he IS a cousin.\"\\n\\nLeaving this address (delivered like a sepulchral message) ringing in\\nthe rafters of the roof, the very little counsel drops, and the fog\\nknows him no more. Everybody looks for him. Nobody can see him.\\n\\n\"I will speak with both the young people,\" says the Chancellor anew,\\n\"and satisfy myself on the subject of their residing with their\\ncousin. I will mention the matter to-morrow morning when I take my\\nseat.\"\\n\\nThe Chancellor is about to bow to the bar when the prisoner is\\npresented. Nothing can possibly come of the prisoner\\'s conglomeration\\nbut his being sent back to prison, which is soon done. The man from\\nShropshire ventures another remonstrative \"My lord!\" but the\\nChancellor, being aware of him, has dexterously vanished. Everybody\\nelse quickly vanishes too. A battery of blue bags is loaded with\\nheavy charges of papers and carried off by clerks; the little mad old\\nwoman marches off with her documents; the empty court is locked up.\\nIf all the injustice it has committed and all the misery it has\\ncaused could only be locked up with it, and the whole burnt away in a\\ngreat funeral pyre--why so much the better for other parties than the\\nparties in Jarndyce and Jarndyce!\\n\\n\\n\\nIt is but a glimpse of the world of fashion that we want on this same\\nmiry afternoon. It is not so unlike the Court of Chancery but that we\\nmay pass from the one scene to the other, as the crow flies. Both the\\nworld of fashion and the Court of Chancery are things of precedent\\nand usage: oversleeping Rip Van Winkles who have played at strange\\ngames through a deal of thundery weather; sleeping beauties whom the\\nknight will wake one day, when all the stopped spits in the kitchen\\nshall begin to turn prodigiously!\\n\\nIt is not a large world. Relatively even to this world of ours, which\\nhas its limits too (as your Highness shall find when you have made\\nthe tour of it and are come to the brink of the void beyond), it is a\\nvery little speck. There is much good in it; there are many good and\\ntrue people in it; it has its appointed place. But the evil of it is\\nthat it is a world wrapped up in too much jeweller\\'s cotton and fine\\nwool, and cannot hear the rushing of the larger worlds, and cannot\\nsee them as they circle round the sun. It is a deadened world, and\\nits growth is sometimes unhealthy for want of air.\\n\\nMy Lady Dedlock has returned to her house in town for a few days\\nprevious to her departure for Paris, where her ladyship intends to\\nstay some weeks, after which her movements are uncertain. The\\nfashionable intelligence says so for the comfort of the Parisians,\\nand it knows all fashionable things. To know things otherwise were to\\nbe unfashionable. My Lady Dedlock has been down at what she calls, in\\nfamiliar conversation, her \"place\" in Lincolnshire. The waters are\\nout in Lincolnshire. An arch of the bridge in the park has been\\nsapped and sopped away. The adjacent low-lying ground for half a mile\\nin breadth is a stagnant river with melancholy trees for islands in\\nit and a surface punctured all over, all day long, with falling rain.\\nMy Lady Dedlock\\'s place has been extremely dreary. The weather for\\nmany a day and night has been so wet that the trees seem wet through,\\nand the soft loppings and prunings of the woodman\\'s axe can make no\\ncrash or crackle as they fall. The deer, looking soaked, leave\\nquagmires where they pass. The shot of a rifle loses its sharpness in\\nthe moist air, and its smoke moves in a tardy little cloud towards\\nthe green rise, coppice-topped, that makes a background for the\\nfalling rain. The view from my Lady Dedlock\\'s own windows is\\nalternately a lead-coloured view and a view in Indian ink. The vases\\non the stone terrace in the foreground catch the rain all day; and\\nthe heavy drops fall--drip, drip, drip--upon the broad flagged\\npavement, called from old time the Ghost\\'s Walk, all night. On\\nSundays the little church in the park is mouldy; the oaken pulpit\\nbreaks out into a cold sweat; and there is a general smell and taste\\nas of the ancient Dedlocks in their graves. My Lady Dedlock (who is\\nchildless), looking out in the early twilight from her boudoir at a\\nkeeper\\'s lodge and seeing the light of a fire upon the latticed\\npanes, and smoke rising from the chimney, and a child, chased by a\\nwoman, running out into the rain to meet the shining figure of a\\nwrapped-up man coming through the gate, has been put quite out of\\ntemper. My Lady Dedlock says she has been \"bored to death.\"\\n\\nTherefore my Lady Dedlock has come away from the place in\\nLincolnshire and has left it to the rain, and the crows, and the\\nrabbits, and the deer, and the partridges and pheasants. The pictures\\nof the Dedlocks past and gone have seemed to vanish into the damp\\nwalls in mere lowness of spirits, as the housekeeper has passed along\\nthe old rooms shutting up the shutters. And when they will next come\\nforth again, the fashionable intelligence--which, like the fiend, is\\nomniscient of the past and present, but not the future--cannot yet\\nundertake to say.\\n\\nSir Leicester Dedlock is only a baronet, but there is no mightier\\nbaronet than he. His family is as old as the hills, and infinitely\\nmore respectable. He has a general opinion that the world might get\\non without hills but would be done up without Dedlocks. He would on\\nthe whole admit nature to be a good idea (a little low, perhaps, when\\nnot enclosed with a park-fence), but an idea dependent for its\\nexecution on your great county families. He is a gentleman of strict\\nconscience, disdainful of all littleness and meanness and ready on\\nthe shortest notice to die any death you may please to mention rather\\nthan give occasion for the least impeachment of his integrity. He is\\nan honourable, obstinate, truthful, high-spirited, intensely\\nprejudiced, perfectly unreasonable man.\\n\\nSir Leicester is twenty years, full measure, older than my Lady. He\\nwill never see sixty-five again, nor perhaps sixty-six, nor yet\\nsixty-seven. He has a twist of the gout now and then and walks a\\nlittle stiffly. He is of a worthy presence, with his light-grey hair\\nand whiskers, his fine shirt-frill, his pure-white waistcoat, and his\\nblue coat with bright buttons always buttoned. He is ceremonious,\\nstately, most polite on every occasion to my Lady, and holds her\\npersonal attractions in the highest estimation. His gallantry to my\\nLady, which has never changed since he courted her, is the one little\\ntouch of romantic fancy in him.\\n\\nIndeed, he married her for love. A whisper still goes about that she\\nhad not even family; howbeit, Sir Leicester had so much family that\\nperhaps he had enough and could dispense with any more. But she had\\nbeauty, pride, ambition, insolent resolve, and sense enough to\\nportion out a legion of fine ladies. Wealth and station, added to\\nthese, soon floated her upward, and for years now my Lady Dedlock has\\nbeen at the centre of the fashionable intelligence and at the top of\\nthe fashionable tree.\\n\\nHow Alexander wept when he had no more worlds to conquer, everybody\\nknows--or has some reason to know by this time, the matter having\\nbeen rather frequently mentioned. My Lady Dedlock, having conquered\\nHER world, fell not into the melting, but rather into the freezing,\\nmood. An exhausted composure, a worn-out placidity, an equanimity of\\nfatigue not to be ruffled by interest or satisfaction, are the\\ntrophies of her victory. She is perfectly well-bred. If she could be\\ntranslated to heaven to-morrow, she might be expected to ascend\\nwithout any rapture.\\n\\nShe has beauty still, and if it be not in its heyday, it is not yet\\nin its autumn. She has a fine face--originally of a character that\\nwould be rather called very pretty than handsome, but improved into\\nclassicality by the acquired expression of her fashionable state. Her\\nfigure is elegant and has the effect of being tall. Not that she is\\nso, but that \"the most is made,\" as the Honourable Bob Stables has\\nfrequently asserted upon oath, \"of all her points.\" The same\\nauthority observes that she is perfectly got up and remarks in\\ncommendation of her hair especially that she is the best-groomed\\nwoman in the whole stud.\\n\\nWith all her perfections on her head, my Lady Dedlock has come up\\nfrom her place in Lincolnshire (hotly pursued by the fashionable\\nintelligence) to pass a few days at her house in town previous to her\\ndeparture for Paris, where her ladyship intends to stay some weeks,\\nafter which her movements are uncertain. And at her house in town,\\nupon this muddy, murky afternoon, presents himself an old-fashioned\\nold gentleman, attorney-at-law and eke solicitor of the High Court of\\nChancery, who has the honour of acting as legal adviser of the\\nDedlocks and has as many cast-iron boxes in his office with that name\\noutside as if the present baronet were the coin of the conjuror\\'s\\ntrick and were constantly being juggled through the whole set. Across\\nthe hall, and up the stairs, and along the passages, and through the\\nrooms, which are very brilliant in the season and very dismal out of\\nit--fairy-land to visit, but a desert to live in--the old gentleman\\nis conducted by a Mercury in powder to my Lady\\'s presence.\\n\\nThe old gentleman is rusty to look at, but is reputed to have made\\ngood thrift out of aristocratic marriage settlements and aristocratic\\nwills, and to be very rich. He is surrounded by a mysterious halo of\\nfamily confidences, of which he is known to be the silent depository.\\nThere are noble mausoleums rooted for centuries in retired glades of\\nparks among the growing timber and the fern, which perhaps hold fewer\\nnoble secrets than walk abroad among men, shut up in the breast of\\nMr. Tulkinghorn. He is of what is called the old school--a phrase\\ngenerally meaning any school that seems never to have been young--and\\nwears knee-breeches tied with ribbons, and gaiters or stockings. One\\npeculiarity of his black clothes and of his black stockings, be they\\nsilk or worsted, is that they never shine. Mute, close, irresponsive\\nto any glancing light, his dress is like himself. He never converses\\nwhen not professionally consulted. He is found sometimes, speechless\\nbut quite at home, at corners of dinner-tables in great country\\nhouses and near doors of drawing-rooms, concerning which the\\nfashionable intelligence is eloquent, where everybody knows him and\\nwhere half the Peerage stops to say \"How do you do, Mr. Tulkinghorn?\"\\nHe receives these salutations with gravity and buries them along with\\nthe rest of his knowledge.\\n\\nSir Leicester Dedlock is with my Lady and is happy to see Mr.\\nTulkinghorn. There is an air of prescription about him which is\\nalways agreeable to Sir Leicester; he receives it as a kind of\\ntribute. He likes Mr. Tulkinghorn\\'s dress; there is a kind of tribute\\nin that too. It is eminently respectable, and likewise, in a general\\nway, retainer-like. It expresses, as it were, the steward of the\\nlegal mysteries, the butler of the legal cellar, of the Dedlocks.\\n\\nHas Mr. Tulkinghorn any idea of this himself? It may be so, or it may\\nnot, but there is this remarkable circumstance to be noted in\\neverything associated with my Lady Dedlock as one of a class--as one\\nof the leaders and representatives of her little world. She supposes\\nherself to be an inscrutable Being, quite out of the reach and ken of\\nordinary mortals--seeing herself in her glass, where indeed she looks\\nso. Yet every dim little star revolving about her, from her maid to\\nthe manager of the Italian Opera, knows her weaknesses, prejudices,\\nfollies, haughtinesses, and caprices and lives upon as accurate a\\ncalculation and as nice a measure of her moral nature as her\\ndressmaker takes of her physical proportions. Is a new dress, a new\\ncustom, a new singer, a new dancer, a new form of jewellery, a new\\ndwarf or giant, a new chapel, a new anything, to be set up? There are\\ndeferential people in a dozen callings whom my Lady Dedlock suspects\\nof nothing but prostration before her, who can tell you how to manage\\nher as if she were a baby, who do nothing but nurse her all their\\nlives, who, humbly affecting to follow with profound subservience,\\nlead her and her whole troop after them; who, in hooking one, hook\\nall and bear them off as Lemuel Gulliver bore away the stately fleet\\nof the majestic Lilliput. \"If you want to address our people, sir,\"\\nsay Blaze and Sparkle, the jewellers--meaning by our people Lady\\nDedlock and the rest--\"you must remember that you are not dealing\\nwith the general public; you must hit our people in their weakest\\nplace, and their weakest place is such a place.\" \"To make this\\narticle go down, gentlemen,\" say Sheen and Gloss, the mercers, to\\ntheir friends the manufacturers, \"you must come to us, because we\\nknow where to have the fashionable people, and we can make it\\nfashionable.\" \"If you want to get this print upon the tables of my\\nhigh connexion, sir,\" says Mr. Sladdery, the librarian, \"or if you\\nwant to get this dwarf or giant into the houses of my high connexion,\\nsir, or if you want to secure to this entertainment the patronage of\\nmy high connexion, sir, you must leave it, if you please, to me, for\\nI have been accustomed to study the leaders of my high connexion,\\nsir, and I may tell you without vanity that I can turn them round my\\nfinger\"--in which Mr. Sladdery, who is an honest man, does not\\nexaggerate at all.\\n\\nTherefore, while Mr. Tulkinghorn may not know what is passing in the\\nDedlock mind at present, it is very possible that he may.\\n\\n\"My Lady\\'s cause has been again before the Chancellor, has it, Mr.\\nTulkinghorn?\" says Sir Leicester, giving him his hand.\\n\\n\"Yes. It has been on again to-day,\" Mr. Tulkinghorn replies, making\\none of his quiet bows to my Lady, who is on a sofa near the fire,\\nshading her face with a hand-screen.\\n\\n\"It would be useless to ask,\" says my Lady with the dreariness of the\\nplace in Lincolnshire still upon her, \"whether anything has been\\ndone.\"\\n\\n\"Nothing that YOU would call anything has been done to-day,\" replies\\nMr. Tulkinghorn.\\n\\n\"Nor ever will be,\" says my Lady.\\n\\nSir Leicester has no objection to an interminable Chancery suit. It\\nis a slow, expensive, British, constitutional kind of thing. To be\\nsure, he has not a vital interest in the suit in question, her part\\nin which was the only property my Lady brought him; and he has a\\nshadowy impression that for his name--the name of Dedlock--to be in a\\ncause, and not in the title of that cause, is a most ridiculous\\naccident. But he regards the Court of Chancery, even if it should\\ninvolve an occasional delay of justice and a trifling amount of\\nconfusion, as a something devised in conjunction with a variety of\\nother somethings by the perfection of human wisdom for the eternal\\nsettlement (humanly speaking) of everything. And he is upon the whole\\nof a fixed opinion that to give the sanction of his countenance to\\nany complaints respecting it would be to encourage some person in the\\nlower classes to rise up somewhere--like Wat Tyler.\\n\\n\"As a few fresh affidavits have been put upon the file,\" says Mr.\\nTulkinghorn, \"and as they are short, and as I proceed upon the\\ntroublesome principle of begging leave to possess my clients with any\\nnew proceedings in a cause\"--cautious man Mr. Tulkinghorn, taking no\\nmore responsibility than necessary--\"and further, as I see you are\\ngoing to Paris, I have brought them in my pocket.\"\\n\\n(Sir Leicester was going to Paris too, by the by, but the delight of\\nthe fashionable intelligence was in his Lady.)\\n\\nMr. Tulkinghorn takes out his papers, asks permission to place them\\non a golden talisman of a table at my Lady\\'s elbow, puts on his\\nspectacles, and begins to read by the light of a shaded lamp.\\n\\n\"\\'In Chancery. Between John Jarndyce--\\'\"\\n\\nMy Lady interrupts, requesting him to miss as many of the formal\\nhorrors as he can.\\n\\nMr. Tulkinghorn glances over his spectacles and begins again lower\\ndown. My Lady carelessly and scornfully abstracts her attention. Sir\\nLeicester in a great chair looks at the file and appears to have a\\nstately liking for the legal repetitions and prolixities as ranging\\namong the national bulwarks. It happens that the fire is hot where my\\nLady sits and that the hand-screen is more beautiful than useful,\\nbeing priceless but small. My Lady, changing her position, sees the\\npapers on the table--looks at them nearer--looks at them nearer\\nstill--asks impulsively, \"Who copied that?\"\\n\\nMr. Tulkinghorn stops short, surprised by my Lady\\'s animation and her\\nunusual tone.\\n\\n\"Is it what you people call law-hand?\" she asks, looking full at him\\nin her careless way again and toying with her screen.\\n\\n\"Not quite. Probably\"--Mr. Tulkinghorn examines it as he speaks--\"the\\nlegal character which it has was acquired after the original hand was\\nformed. Why do you ask?\"\\n\\n\"Anything to vary this detestable monotony. Oh, go on, do!\"\\n\\nMr. Tulkinghorn reads again. The heat is greater; my Lady screens her\\nface. Sir Leicester dozes, starts up suddenly, and cries, \"Eh? What\\ndo you say?\"\\n\\n\"I say I am afraid,\" says Mr. Tulkinghorn, who had risen hastily,\\n\"that Lady Dedlock is ill.\"\\n\\n\"Faint,\" my Lady murmurs with white lips, \"only that; but it is like\\nthe faintness of death. Don\\'t speak to me. Ring, and take me to my\\nroom!\"\\n\\nMr. Tulkinghorn retires into another chamber; bells ring, feet\\nshuffle and patter, silence ensues. Mercury at last begs Mr.\\nTulkinghorn to return.\\n\\n\"Better now,\" quoth Sir Leicester, motioning the lawyer to sit down\\nand read to him alone. \"I have been quite alarmed. I never knew my\\nLady swoon before. But the weather is extremely trying, and she\\nreally has been bored to death down at our place in Lincolnshire.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nI have a great deal of difficulty in beginning to write my portion of\\nthese pages, for I know I am not clever. I always knew that. I can\\nremember, when I was a very little girl indeed, I used to say to my\\ndoll when we were alone together, \"Now, Dolly, I am not clever, you\\nknow very well, and you must be patient with me, like a dear!\" And so\\nshe used to sit propped up in a great arm-chair, with her beautiful\\ncomplexion and rosy lips, staring at me--or not so much at me, I\\nthink, as at nothing--while I busily stitched away and told her every\\none of my secrets.\\n\\nMy dear old doll! I was such a shy little thing that I seldom dared\\nto open my lips, and never dared to open my heart, to anybody else.\\nIt almost makes me cry to think what a relief it used to be to me\\nwhen I came home from school of a day to run upstairs to my room and\\nsay, \"Oh, you dear faithful Dolly, I knew you would be expecting me!\"\\nand then to sit down on the floor, leaning on the elbow of her great\\nchair, and tell her all I had noticed since we parted. I had always\\nrather a noticing way--not a quick way, oh, no!--a silent way of\\nnoticing what passed before me and thinking I should like to\\nunderstand it better. I have not by any means a quick understanding.\\nWhen I love a person very tenderly indeed, it seems to brighten. But\\neven that may be my vanity.\\n\\nI was brought up, from my earliest remembrance--like some of the\\nprincesses in the fairy stories, only I was not charming--by my\\ngodmother. At least, I only knew her as such. She was a good, good\\nwoman! She went to church three times every Sunday, and to morning\\nprayers on Wednesdays and Fridays, and to lectures whenever there\\nwere lectures; and never missed. She was handsome; and if she had\\never smiled, would have been (I used to think) like an angel--but she\\nnever smiled. She was always grave and strict. She was so very good\\nherself, I thought, that the badness of other people made her frown\\nall her life. I felt so different from her, even making every\\nallowance for the differences between a child and a woman; I felt so\\npoor, so trifling, and so far off that I never could be unrestrained\\nwith her--no, could never even love her as I wished. It made me very\\nsorry to consider how good she was and how unworthy of her I was, and\\nI used ardently to hope that I might have a better heart; and I\\ntalked it over very often with the dear old doll, but I never loved\\nmy godmother as I ought to have loved her and as I felt I must have\\nloved her if I had been a better girl.\\n\\nThis made me, I dare say, more timid and retiring than I naturally\\nwas and cast me upon Dolly as the only friend with whom I felt at\\nease. But something happened when I was still quite a little thing\\nthat helped it very much.\\n\\nI had never heard my mama spoken of. I had never heard of my papa\\neither, but I felt more interested about my mama. I had never worn a\\nblack frock, that I could recollect. I had never been shown my mama\\'s\\ngrave. I had never been told where it was. Yet I had never been\\ntaught to pray for any relation but my godmother. I had more than\\nonce approached this subject of my thoughts with Mrs. Rachael, our\\nonly servant, who took my light away when I was in bed (another very\\ngood woman, but austere to me), and she had only said, \"Esther, good\\nnight!\" and gone away and left me.\\n\\nAlthough there were seven girls at the neighbouring school where I\\nwas a day boarder, and although they called me little Esther\\nSummerson, I knew none of them at home. All of them were older than\\nI, to be sure (I was the youngest there by a good deal), but there\\nseemed to be some other separation between us besides that, and\\nbesides their being far more clever than I was and knowing much more\\nthan I did. One of them in the first week of my going to the school\\n(I remember it very well) invited me home to a little party, to my\\ngreat joy. But my godmother wrote a stiff letter declining for me,\\nand I never went. I never went out at all.\\n\\nIt was my birthday. There were holidays at school on other\\nbirthdays--none on mine. There were rejoicings at home on other\\nbirthdays, as I knew from what I heard the girls relate to one\\nanother--there were none on mine. My birthday was the most melancholy\\nday at home in the whole year.\\n\\nI have mentioned that unless my vanity should deceive me (as I know\\nit may, for I may be very vain without suspecting it, though indeed I\\ndon\\'t), my comprehension is quickened when my affection is. My\\ndisposition is very affectionate, and perhaps I might still feel such\\na wound if such a wound could be received more than once with the\\nquickness of that birthday.\\n\\nDinner was over, and my godmother and I were sitting at the table\\nbefore the fire. The clock ticked, the fire clicked; not another\\nsound had been heard in the room or in the house for I don\\'t know how\\nlong. I happened to look timidly up from my stitching, across the\\ntable at my godmother, and I saw in her face, looking gloomily at me,\\n\"It would have been far better, little Esther, that you had had no\\nbirthday, that you had never been born!\"\\n\\nI broke out crying and sobbing, and I said, \"Oh, dear godmother, tell\\nme, pray do tell me, did Mama die on my birthday?\"\\n\\n\"No,\" she returned. \"Ask me no more, child!\"\\n\\n\"Oh, do pray tell me something of her. Do now, at last, dear\\ngodmother, if you please! What did I do to her? How did I lose her?\\nWhy am I so different from other children, and why is it my fault,\\ndear godmother? No, no, no, don\\'t go away. Oh, speak to me!\"\\n\\nI was in a kind of fright beyond my grief, and I caught hold of her\\ndress and was kneeling to her. She had been saying all the while,\\n\"Let me go!\" But now she stood still.\\n\\nHer darkened face had such power over me that it stopped me in the\\nmidst of my vehemence. I put up my trembling little hand to clasp\\nhers or to beg her pardon with what earnestness I might, but withdrew\\nit as she looked at me, and laid it on my fluttering heart. She\\nraised me, sat in her chair, and standing me before her, said slowly\\nin a cold, low voice--I see her knitted brow and pointed\\nfinger--\"Your mother, Esther, is your disgrace, and you were hers.\\nThe time will come--and soon enough--when you will understand this\\nbetter and will feel it too, as no one save a woman can. I have\\nforgiven her\"--but her face did not relent--\"the wrong she did to me,\\nand I say no more of it, though it was greater than you will ever\\nknow--than any one will ever know but I, the sufferer. For yourself,\\nunfortunate girl, orphaned and degraded from the first of these evil\\nanniversaries, pray daily that the sins of others be not visited upon\\nyour head, according to what is written. Forget your mother and leave\\nall other people to forget her who will do her unhappy child that\\ngreatest kindness. Now, go!\"\\n\\nShe checked me, however, as I was about to depart from her--so frozen\\nas I was!--and added this, \"Submission, self-denial, diligent work,\\nare the preparations for a life begun with such a shadow on it. You\\nare different from other children, Esther, because you were not born,\\nlike them, in common sinfulness and wrath. You are set apart.\"\\n\\nI went up to my room, and crept to bed, and laid my doll\\'s cheek\\nagainst mine wet with tears, and holding that solitary friend upon my\\nbosom, cried myself to sleep. Imperfect as my understanding of my\\nsorrow was, I knew that I had brought no joy at any time to anybody\\'s\\nheart and that I was to no one upon earth what Dolly was to me.\\n\\nDear, dear, to think how much time we passed alone together\\nafterwards, and how often I repeated to the doll the story of my\\nbirthday and confided to her that I would try as hard as ever I could\\nto repair the fault I had been born with (of which I confessedly felt\\nguilty and yet innocent) and would strive as I grew up to be\\nindustrious, contented, and kind-hearted and to do some good to some\\none, and win some love to myself if I could. I hope it is not\\nself-indulgent to shed these tears as I think of it. I am very\\nthankful, I am very cheerful, but I cannot quite help their coming to\\nmy eyes.\\n\\nThere! I have wiped them away now and can go on again properly.\\n\\nI felt the distance between my godmother and myself so much more\\nafter the birthday, and felt so sensible of filling a place in her\\nhouse which ought to have been empty, that I found her more difficult\\nof approach, though I was fervently grateful to her in my heart, than\\never. I felt in the same way towards my school companions; I felt in\\nthe same way towards Mrs. Rachael, who was a widow; and oh, towards\\nher daughter, of whom she was proud, who came to see her once a\\nfortnight! I was very retired and quiet, and tried to be very\\ndiligent.\\n\\nOne sunny afternoon when I had come home from school with my books\\nand portfolio, watching my long shadow at my side, and as I was\\ngliding upstairs to my room as usual, my godmother looked out of the\\nparlour-door and called me back. Sitting with her, I found--which was\\nvery unusual indeed--a stranger. A portly, important-looking\\ngentleman, dressed all in black, with a white cravat, large gold\\nwatch seals, a pair of gold eye-glasses, and a large seal-ring upon\\nhis little finger.\\n\\n\"This,\" said my godmother in an undertone, \"is the child.\" Then she\\nsaid in her naturally stern way of speaking, \"This is Esther, sir.\"\\n\\nThe gentleman put up his eye-glasses to look at me and said, \"Come\\nhere, my dear!\" He shook hands with me and asked me to take off my\\nbonnet, looking at me all the while. When I had complied, he said,\\n\"Ah!\" and afterwards \"Yes!\" And then, taking off his eye-glasses and\\nfolding them in a red case, and leaning back in his arm-chair,\\nturning the case about in his two hands, he gave my godmother a nod.\\nUpon that, my godmother said, \"You may go upstairs, Esther!\" And I\\nmade him my curtsy and left him.\\n\\nIt must have been two years afterwards, and I was almost fourteen,\\nwhen one dreadful night my godmother and I sat at the fireside. I was\\nreading aloud, and she was listening. I had come down at nine o\\'clock\\nas I always did to read the Bible to her, and was reading from St.\\nJohn how our Saviour stooped down, writing with his finger in the\\ndust, when they brought the sinful woman to him.\\n\\n\"So when they continued asking him, he lifted up himself and said\\nunto them, \\'He that is without sin among you, let him first cast a\\nstone at her!\\'\"\\n\\nI was stopped by my godmother\\'s rising, putting her hand to her head,\\nand crying out in an awful voice from quite another part of the book,\\n\"\\'Watch ye, therefore, lest coming suddenly he find you sleeping. And\\nwhat I say unto you, I say unto all, Watch!\\'\"\\n\\nIn an instant, while she stood before me repeating these words, she\\nfell down on the floor. I had no need to cry out; her voice had\\nsounded through the house and been heard in the street.\\n\\nShe was laid upon her bed. For more than a week she lay there, little\\naltered outwardly, with her old handsome resolute frown that I so\\nwell knew carved upon her face. Many and many a time, in the day and\\nin the night, with my head upon the pillow by her that my whispers\\nmight be plainer to her, I kissed her, thanked her, prayed for her,\\nasked her for her blessing and forgiveness, entreated her to give me\\nthe least sign that she knew or heard me. No, no, no. Her face was\\nimmovable. To the very last, and even afterwards, her frown remained\\nunsoftened.\\n\\nOn the day after my poor good godmother was buried, the gentleman in\\nblack with the white neckcloth reappeared. I was sent for by Mrs.\\nRachael, and found him in the same place, as if he had never gone\\naway.\\n\\n\"My name is Kenge,\" he said; \"you may remember it, my child; Kenge\\nand Carboy, Lincoln\\'s Inn.\"\\n\\nI replied that I remembered to have seen him once before.\\n\\n\"Pray be seated--here near me. Don\\'t distress yourself; it\\'s of no\\nuse. Mrs. Rachael, I needn\\'t inform you who were acquainted with the\\nlate Miss Barbary\\'s affairs, that her means die with her and that\\nthis young lady, now her aunt is dead--\"\\n\\n\"My aunt, sir!\"\\n\\n\"It is really of no use carrying on a deception when no object is to\\nbe gained by it,\" said Mr. Kenge smoothly, \"Aunt in fact, though not\\nin law. Don\\'t distress yourself! Don\\'t weep! Don\\'t tremble! Mrs.\\nRachael, our young friend has no doubt heard of--the--a--Jarndyce and\\nJarndyce.\"\\n\\n\"Never,\" said Mrs. Rachael.\\n\\n\"Is it possible,\" pursued Mr. Kenge, putting up his eye-glasses,\\n\"that our young friend--I BEG you won\\'t distress yourself!--never\\nheard of Jarndyce and Jarndyce!\"\\n\\nI shook my head, wondering even what it was.\\n\\n\"Not of Jarndyce and Jarndyce?\" said Mr. Kenge, looking over his\\nglasses at me and softly turning the case about and about as if he\\nwere petting something. \"Not of one of the greatest Chancery suits\\nknown? Not of Jarndyce and Jarndyce--the--a--in itself a monument of\\nChancery practice. In which (I would say) every difficulty, every\\ncontingency, every masterly fiction, every form of procedure known\\nin that court, is represented over and over again? It is a cause\\nthat could not exist out of this free and great country. I should\\nsay that the aggregate of costs in Jarndyce and Jarndyce, Mrs.\\nRachael\"--I was afraid he addressed himself to her because I appeared\\ninattentive\"--amounts at the present hour to from SIX-ty to SEVEN-ty\\nTHOUSAND POUNDS!\" said Mr. Kenge, leaning back in his chair.\\n\\nI felt very ignorant, but what could I do? I was so entirely\\nunacquainted with the subject that I understood nothing about it even\\nthen.\\n\\n\"And she really never heard of the cause!\" said Mr. Kenge.\\n\"Surprising!\"\\n\\n\"Miss Barbary, sir,\" returned Mrs. Rachael, \"who is now among the\\nSeraphim--\"\\n\\n\"I hope so, I am sure,\" said Mr. Kenge politely.\\n\\n\"--Wished Esther only to know what would be serviceable to her. And\\nshe knows, from any teaching she has had here, nothing more.\"\\n\\n\"Well!\" said Mr. Kenge. \"Upon the whole, very proper. Now to the\\npoint,\" addressing me. \"Miss Barbary, your sole relation (in fact\\nthat is, for I am bound to observe that in law you had none) being\\ndeceased and it naturally not being to be expected that Mrs.\\nRachael--\"\\n\\n\"Oh, dear no!\" said Mrs. Rachael quickly.\\n\\n\"Quite so,\" assented Mr. Kenge; \"--that Mrs. Rachael should charge\\nherself with your maintenance and support (I beg you won\\'t distress\\nyourself), you are in a position to receive the renewal of an offer\\nwhich I was instructed to make to Miss Barbary some two years ago and\\nwhich, though rejected then, was understood to be renewable under the\\nlamentable circumstances that have since occurred. Now, if I avow\\nthat I represent, in Jarndyce and Jarndyce and otherwise, a highly\\nhumane, but at the same time singular, man, shall I compromise myself\\nby any stretch of my professional caution?\" said Mr. Kenge, leaning\\nback in his chair again and looking calmly at us both.\\n\\nHe appeared to enjoy beyond everything the sound of his own voice. I\\ncouldn\\'t wonder at that, for it was mellow and full and gave great\\nimportance to every word he uttered. He listened to himself with\\nobvious satisfaction and sometimes gently beat time to his own music\\nwith his head or rounded a sentence with his hand. I was very much\\nimpressed by him--even then, before I knew that he formed himself on\\nthe model of a great lord who was his client and that he was\\ngenerally called Conversation Kenge.\\n\\n\"Mr. Jarndyce,\" he pursued, \"being aware of the--I would say,\\ndesolate--position of our young friend, offers to place her at a\\nfirst-rate establishment where her education shall be completed,\\nwhere her comfort shall be secured, where her reasonable wants shall\\nbe anticipated, where she shall be eminently qualified to discharge\\nher duty in that station of life unto which it has pleased--shall I\\nsay Providence?--to call her.\"\\n\\nMy heart was filled so full, both by what he said and by his\\naffecting manner of saying it, that I was not able to speak, though I\\ntried.\\n\\n\"Mr. Jarndyce,\" he went on, \"makes no condition beyond expressing his\\nexpectation that our young friend will not at any time remove herself\\nfrom the establishment in question without his knowledge and\\nconcurrence. That she will faithfully apply herself to the\\nacquisition of those accomplishments, upon the exercise of which she\\nwill be ultimately dependent. That she will tread in the paths of\\nvirtue and honour, and--the--a--so forth.\"\\n\\nI was still less able to speak than before.\\n\\n\"Now, what does our young friend say?\" proceeded Mr. Kenge. \"Take\\ntime, take time! I pause for her reply. But take time!\"\\n\\nWhat the destitute subject of such an offer tried to say, I need not\\nrepeat. What she did say, I could more easily tell, if it were worth\\nthe telling. What she felt, and will feel to her dying hour, I could\\nnever relate.\\n\\nThis interview took place at Windsor, where I had passed (as far as I\\nknew) my whole life. On that day week, amply provided with all\\nnecessaries, I left it, inside the stagecoach, for Reading.\\n\\nMrs. Rachael was too good to feel any emotion at parting, but I was\\nnot so good, and wept bitterly. I thought that I ought to have known\\nher better after so many years and ought to have made myself enough\\nof a favourite with her to make her sorry then. When she gave me one\\ncold parting kiss upon my forehead, like a thaw-drop from the stone\\nporch--it was a very frosty day--I felt so miserable and\\nself-reproachful that I clung to her and told her it was my fault, I\\nknew, that she could say good-bye so easily!\\n\\n\"No, Esther!\" she returned. \"It is your misfortune!\"\\n\\nThe coach was at the little lawn-gate--we had not come out until we\\nheard the wheels--and thus I left her, with a sorrowful heart. She\\nwent in before my boxes were lifted to the coach-roof and shut the\\ndoor. As long as I could see the house, I looked back at it from the\\nwindow through my tears. My godmother had left Mrs. Rachael all the\\nlittle property she possessed; and there was to be a sale; and an old\\nhearth-rug with roses on it, which always seemed to me the first\\nthing in the world I had ever seen, was hanging outside in the frost\\nand snow. A day or two before, I had wrapped the dear old doll in her\\nown shawl and quietly laid her--I am half ashamed to tell it--in the\\ngarden-earth under the tree that shaded my old window. I had no\\ncompanion left but my bird, and him I carried with me in his cage.\\n\\nWhen the house was out of sight, I sat, with my bird-cage in the\\nstraw at my feet, forward on the low seat to look out of the high\\nwindow, watching the frosty trees, that were like beautiful pieces of\\nspar, and the fields all smooth and white with last night\\'s snow, and\\nthe sun, so red but yielding so little heat, and the ice, dark like\\nmetal where the skaters and sliders had brushed the snow away. There\\nwas a gentleman in the coach who sat on the opposite seat and looked\\nvery large in a quantity of wrappings, but he sat gazing out of the\\nother window and took no notice of me.\\n\\nI thought of my dead godmother, of the night when I read to her, of\\nher frowning so fixedly and sternly in her bed, of the strange place\\nI was going to, of the people I should find there, and what they\\nwould be like, and what they would say to me, when a voice in the\\ncoach gave me a terrible start.\\n\\nIt said, \"What the de-vil are you crying for?\"\\n\\nI was so frightened that I lost my voice and could only answer in a\\nwhisper, \"Me, sir?\" For of course I knew it must have been the\\ngentleman in the quantity of wrappings, though he was still looking\\nout of his window.\\n\\n\"Yes, you,\" he said, turning round.\\n\\n\"I didn\\'t know I was crying, sir,\" I faltered.\\n\\n\"But you are!\" said the gentleman. \"Look here!\" He came quite\\nopposite to me from the other corner of the coach, brushed one of his\\nlarge furry cuffs across my eyes (but without hurting me), and showed\\nme that it was wet.\\n\\n\"There! Now you know you are,\" he said. \"Don\\'t you?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, sir,\" I said.\\n\\n\"And what are you crying for?\" said the gentleman, \"Don\\'t you want to\\ngo there?\"\\n\\n\"Where, sir?\"\\n\\n\"Where? Why, wherever you are going,\" said the gentleman.\\n\\n\"I am very glad to go there, sir,\" I answered.\\n\\n\"Well, then! Look glad!\" said the gentleman.\\n\\nI thought he was very strange, or at least that what I could see of\\nhim was very strange, for he was wrapped up to the chin, and his face\\nwas almost hidden in a fur cap with broad fur straps at the side of\\nhis head fastened under his chin; but I was composed again, and not\\nafraid of him. So I told him that I thought I must have been crying\\nbecause of my godmother\\'s death and because of Mrs. Rachael\\'s not\\nbeing sorry to part with me.\\n\\n\"Confound Mrs. Rachael!\" said the gentleman. \"Let her fly away in a\\nhigh wind on a broomstick!\"\\n\\nI began to be really afraid of him now and looked at him with the\\ngreatest astonishment. But I thought that he had pleasant eyes,\\nalthough he kept on muttering to himself in an angry manner and\\ncalling Mrs. Rachael names.\\n\\nAfter a little while he opened his outer wrapper, which appeared to\\nme large enough to wrap up the whole coach, and put his arm down into\\na deep pocket in the side.\\n\\n\"Now, look here!\" he said. \"In this paper,\" which was nicely folded,\\n\"is a piece of the best plum-cake that can be got for money--sugar on\\nthe outside an inch thick, like fat on mutton chops. Here\\'s a little\\npie (a gem this is, both for size and quality), made in France. And\\nwhat do you suppose it\\'s made of? Livers of fat geese. There\\'s a pie!\\nNow let\\'s see you eat \\'em.\"\\n\\n\"Thank you, sir,\" I replied; \"thank you very much indeed, but I hope\\nyou won\\'t be offended--they are too rich for me.\"\\n\\n\"Floored again!\" said the gentleman, which I didn\\'t at all\\nunderstand, and threw them both out of window.\\n\\nHe did not speak to me any more until he got out of the coach a\\nlittle way short of Reading, when he advised me to be a good girl and\\nto be studious, and shook hands with me. I must say I was relieved by\\nhis departure. We left him at a milestone. I often walked past it\\nafterwards, and never for a long time without thinking of him and\\nhalf expecting to meet him. But I never did; and so, as time went on,\\nhe passed out of my mind.\\n\\nWhen the coach stopped, a very neat lady looked up at the window and\\nsaid, \"Miss Donny.\"\\n\\n\"No, ma\\'am, Esther Summerson.\"\\n\\n\"That is quite right,\" said the lady, \"Miss Donny.\"\\n\\nI now understood that she introduced herself by that name, and begged\\nMiss Donny\\'s pardon for my mistake, and pointed out my boxes at her\\nrequest. Under the direction of a very neat maid, they were put\\noutside a very small green carriage; and then Miss Donny, the maid,\\nand I got inside and were driven away.\\n\\n\"Everything is ready for you, Esther,\" said Miss Donny, \"and the\\nscheme of your pursuits has been arranged in exact accordance with\\nthe wishes of your guardian, Mr. Jarndyce.\"\\n\\n\"Of--did you say, ma\\'am?\"\\n\\n\"Of your guardian, Mr. Jarndyce,\" said Miss Donny.\\n\\nI was so bewildered that Miss Donny thought the cold had been too\\nsevere for me and lent me her smelling-bottle.\\n\\n\"Do you know my--guardian, Mr. Jarndyce, ma\\'am?\" I asked after a good\\ndeal of hesitation.\\n\\n\"Not personally, Esther,\" said Miss Donny; \"merely through his\\nsolicitors, Messrs. Kenge and Carboy, of London. A very superior\\ngentleman, Mr. Kenge. Truly eloquent indeed. Some of his periods\\nquite majestic!\"\\n\\nI felt this to be very true but was too confused to attend to it. Our\\nspeedy arrival at our destination, before I had time to recover\\nmyself, increased my confusion, and I never shall forget the\\nuncertain and the unreal air of everything at Greenleaf (Miss Donny\\'s\\nhouse) that afternoon!\\n\\nBut I soon became used to it. I was so adapted to the routine of\\nGreenleaf before long that I seemed to have been there a great while\\nand almost to have dreamed rather than really lived my old life at my\\ngodmother\\'s. Nothing could be more precise, exact, and orderly than\\nGreenleaf. There was a time for everything all round the dial of the\\nclock, and everything was done at its appointed moment.\\n\\nWe were twelve boarders, and there were two Miss Donnys, twins. It\\nwas understood that I would have to depend, by and by, on my\\nqualifications as a governess, and I was not only instructed in\\neverything that was taught at Greenleaf, but was very soon engaged in\\nhelping to instruct others. Although I was treated in every other\\nrespect like the rest of the school, this single difference was made\\nin my case from the first. As I began to know more, I taught more,\\nand so in course of time I had plenty to do, which I was very fond of\\ndoing because it made the dear girls fond of me. At last, whenever a\\nnew pupil came who was a little downcast and unhappy, she was so\\nsure--indeed I don\\'t know why--to make a friend of me that all\\nnew-comers were confided to my care. They said I was so gentle, but I\\nam sure THEY were! I often thought of the resolution I had made on my\\nbirthday to try to be industrious, contented, and true-hearted and to\\ndo some good to some one and win some love if I could; and indeed,\\nindeed, I felt almost ashamed to have done so little and have won so\\nmuch.\\n\\nI passed at Greenleaf six happy, quiet years. I never saw in any face\\nthere, thank heaven, on my birthday, that it would have been better\\nif I had never been born. When the day came round, it brought me so\\nmany tokens of affectionate remembrance that my room was beautiful\\nwith them from New Year\\'s Day to Christmas.\\n\\nIn those six years I had never been away except on visits at holiday\\ntime in the neighbourhood. After the first six months or so I had\\ntaken Miss Donny\\'s advice in reference to the propriety of writing to\\nMr. Kenge to say that I was happy and grateful, and with her approval\\nI had written such a letter. I had received a formal answer\\nacknowledging its receipt and saying, \"We note the contents thereof,\\nwhich shall be duly communicated to our client.\" After that I\\nsometimes heard Miss Donny and her sister mention how regular my\\naccounts were paid, and about twice a year I ventured to write a\\nsimilar letter. I always received by return of post exactly the same\\nanswer in the same round hand, with the signature of Kenge and Carboy\\nin another writing, which I supposed to be Mr. Kenge\\'s.\\n\\nIt seems so curious to me to be obliged to write all this about\\nmyself! As if this narrative were the narrative of MY life! But my\\nlittle body will soon fall into the background now.\\n\\nSix quiet years (I find I am saying it for the second time) I had\\npassed at Greenleaf, seeing in those around me, as it might be in a\\nlooking-glass, every stage of my own growth and change there, when,\\none November morning, I received this letter. I omit the date.\\n\\n\\n   Old Square, Lincoln\\'s Inn\\n\\n   Madam,\\n\\n   Jarndyce and Jarndyce\\n\\n   Our clt Mr. Jarndyce being abt to rece into his house,\\n   under an Order of the Ct of Chy, a Ward of the Ct in this\\n   cause, for whom he wishes to secure an elgble compn,\\n   directs us to inform you that he will be glad of your\\n   serces in the afsd capacity.\\n\\n   We have arrngd for your being forded, carriage free, pr\\n   eight o\\'clock coach from Reading, on Monday morning next,\\n   to White Horse Cellar, Piccadilly, London, where one of\\n   our clks will be in waiting to convey you to our offe as\\n   above.\\n\\n   We are, Madam, Your obedt Servts,\\n\\n   Kenge and Carboy\\n\\n   Miss Esther Summerson\\n\\n\\nOh, never, never, never shall I forget the emotion this letter caused\\nin the house! It was so tender in them to care so much for me, it was\\nso gracious in that father who had not forgotten me to have made my\\norphan way so smooth and easy and to have inclined so many youthful\\nnatures towards me, that I could hardly bear it. Not that I would\\nhave had them less sorry--I am afraid not; but the pleasure of it,\\nand the pain of it, and the pride and joy of it, and the humble\\nregret of it were so blended that my heart seemed almost breaking\\nwhile it was full of rapture.\\n\\nThe letter gave me only five days\\' notice of my removal. When every\\nminute added to the proofs of love and kindness that were given me in\\nthose five days, and when at last the morning came and when they took\\nme through all the rooms that I might see them for the last time, and\\nwhen some cried, \"Esther, dear, say good-bye to me here at my\\nbedside, where you first spoke so kindly to me!\" and when others\\nasked me only to write their names, \"With Esther\\'s love,\" and when\\nthey all surrounded me with their parting presents and clung to me\\nweeping and cried, \"What shall we do when dear, dear Esther\\'s gone!\"\\nand when I tried to tell them how forbearing and how good they had\\nall been to me and how I blessed and thanked them every one, what a\\nheart I had!\\n\\nAnd when the two Miss Donnys grieved as much to part with me as the\\nleast among them, and when the maids said, \"Bless you, miss, wherever\\nyou go!\" and when the ugly lame old gardener, who I thought had\\nhardly noticed me in all those years, came panting after the coach to\\ngive me a little nosegay of geraniums and told me I had been the\\nlight of his eyes--indeed the old man said so!--what a heart I had\\nthen!\\n\\nAnd could I help it if with all this, and the coming to the little\\nschool, and the unexpected sight of the poor children outside waving\\ntheir hats and bonnets to me, and of a grey-haired gentleman and lady\\nwhose daughter I had helped to teach and at whose house I had visited\\n(who were said to be the proudest people in all that country), caring\\nfor nothing but calling out, \"Good-bye, Esther. May you be very\\nhappy!\"--could I help it if I was quite bowed down in the coach by\\nmyself and said \"Oh, I am so thankful, I am so thankful!\" many times\\nover!\\n\\nBut of course I soon considered that I must not take tears where I\\nwas going after all that had been done for me. Therefore, of course,\\nI made myself sob less and persuaded myself to be quiet by saying\\nvery often, \"Esther, now you really must! This WILL NOT do!\" I\\ncheered myself up pretty well at last, though I am afraid I was\\nlonger about it than I ought to have been; and when I had cooled my\\neyes with lavender water, it was time to watch for London.\\n\\nI was quite persuaded that we were there when we were ten miles off,\\nand when we really were there, that we should never get there.\\nHowever, when we began to jolt upon a stone pavement, and\\nparticularly when every other conveyance seemed to be running into\\nus, and we seemed to be running into every other conveyance, I began\\nto believe that we really were approaching the end of our journey.\\nVery soon afterwards we stopped.\\n\\nA young gentleman who had inked himself by accident addressed me from\\nthe pavement and said, \"I am from Kenge and Carboy\\'s, miss, of\\nLincoln\\'s Inn.\"\\n\\n\"If you please, sir,\" said I.\\n\\nHe was very obliging, and as he handed me into a fly after\\nsuperintending the removal of my boxes, I asked him whether there was\\na great fire anywhere? For the streets were so full of dense brown\\nsmoke that scarcely anything was to be seen.\\n\\n\"Oh, dear no, miss,\" he said. \"This is a London particular.\"\\n\\nI had never heard of such a thing.\\n\\n\"A fog, miss,\" said the young gentleman.\\n\\n\"Oh, indeed!\" said I.\\n\\nWe drove slowly through the dirtiest and darkest streets that ever\\nwere seen in the world (I thought) and in such a distracting state of\\nconfusion that I wondered how the people kept their senses, until we\\npassed into sudden quietude under an old gateway and drove on through\\na silent square until we came to an odd nook in a corner, where there\\nwas an entrance up a steep, broad flight of stairs, like an entrance\\nto a church. And there really was a churchyard outside under some\\ncloisters, for I saw the gravestones from the staircase window.\\n\\nThis was Kenge and Carboy\\'s. The young gentleman showed me through an\\nouter office into Mr. Kenge\\'s room--there was no one in it--and\\npolitely put an arm-chair for me by the fire. He then called my\\nattention to a little looking-glass hanging from a nail on one side\\nof the chimney-piece.\\n\\n\"In case you should wish to look at yourself, miss, after the\\njourney, as you\\'re going before the Chancellor. Not that it\\'s\\nrequisite, I am sure,\" said the young gentleman civilly.\\n\\n\"Going before the Chancellor?\" I said, startled for a moment.\\n\\n\"Only a matter of form, miss,\" returned the young gentleman. \"Mr.\\nKenge is in court now. He left his compliments, and would you partake\\nof some refreshment\"--there were biscuits and a decanter of wine on a\\nsmall table--\"and look over the paper,\" which the young gentleman\\ngave me as he spoke. He then stirred the fire and left me.\\n\\nEverything was so strange--the stranger from its being night in the\\nday-time, the candles burning with a white flame, and looking raw and\\ncold--that I read the words in the newspaper without knowing what\\nthey meant and found myself reading the same words repeatedly. As it\\nwas of no use going on in that way, I put the paper down, took a peep\\nat my bonnet in the glass to see if it was neat, and looked at the\\nroom, which was not half lighted, and at the shabby, dusty tables,\\nand at the piles of writings, and at a bookcase full of the most\\ninexpressive-looking books that ever had anything to say for\\nthemselves. Then I went on, thinking, thinking, thinking; and the\\nfire went on, burning, burning, burning; and the candles went on\\nflickering and guttering, and there were no snuffers--until the young\\ngentleman by and by brought a very dirty pair--for two hours.\\n\\nAt last Mr. Kenge came. HE was not altered, but he was surprised to\\nsee how altered I was and appeared quite pleased. \"As you are going\\nto be the companion of the young lady who is now in the Chancellor\\'s\\nprivate room, Miss Summerson,\" he said, \"we thought it well that you\\nshould be in attendance also. You will not be discomposed by the Lord\\nChancellor, I dare say?\"\\n\\n\"No, sir,\" I said, \"I don\\'t think I shall,\" really not seeing on\\nconsideration why I should be.\\n\\nSo Mr. Kenge gave me his arm and we went round the corner, under a\\ncolonnade, and in at a side door. And so we came, along a passage,\\ninto a comfortable sort of room where a young lady and a young\\ngentleman were standing near a great, loud-roaring fire. A screen was\\ninterposed between them and it, and they were leaning on the screen,\\ntalking.\\n\\nThey both looked up when I came in, and I saw in the young lady, with\\nthe fire shining upon her, such a beautiful girl! With such rich\\ngolden hair, such soft blue eyes, and such a bright, innocent,\\ntrusting face!\\n\\n\"Miss Ada,\" said Mr. Kenge, \"this is Miss Summerson.\"\\n\\nShe came to meet me with a smile of welcome and her hand extended,\\nbut seemed to change her mind in a moment and kissed me. In short,\\nshe had such a natural, captivating, winning manner that in a few\\nminutes we were sitting in the window-seat, with the light of the\\nfire upon us, talking together as free and happy as could be.\\n\\nWhat a load off my mind! It was so delightful to know that she could\\nconfide in me and like me! It was so good of her, and so encouraging\\nto me!\\n\\nThe young gentleman was her distant cousin, she told me, and his name\\nRichard Carstone. He was a handsome youth with an ingenuous face and\\na most engaging laugh; and after she had called him up to where we\\nsat, he stood by us, in the light of the fire, talking gaily, like a\\nlight-hearted boy. He was very young, not more than nineteen then, if\\nquite so much, but nearly two years older than she was. They were\\nboth orphans and (what was very unexpected and curious to me) had\\nnever met before that day. Our all three coming together for the\\nfirst time in such an unusual place was a thing to talk about, and we\\ntalked about it; and the fire, which had left off roaring, winked its\\nred eyes at us--as Richard said--like a drowsy old Chancery lion.\\n\\nWe conversed in a low tone because a full-dressed gentleman in a bag\\nwig frequently came in and out, and when he did so, we could hear a\\ndrawling sound in the distance, which he said was one of the counsel\\nin our case addressing the Lord Chancellor. He told Mr. Kenge that\\nthe Chancellor would be up in five minutes; and presently we heard a\\nbustle and a tread of feet, and Mr. Kenge said that the Court had\\nrisen and his lordship was in the next room.\\n\\nThe gentleman in the bag wig opened the door almost directly and\\nrequested Mr. Kenge to come in. Upon that, we all went into the next\\nroom, Mr. Kenge first, with my darling--it is so natural to me now\\nthat I can\\'t help writing it; and there, plainly dressed in black and\\nsitting in an arm-chair at a table near the fire, was his lordship,\\nwhose robe, trimmed with beautiful gold lace, was thrown upon another\\nchair. He gave us a searching look as we entered, but his manner was\\nboth courtly and kind.\\n\\nThe gentleman in the bag wig laid bundles of papers on his lordship\\'s\\ntable, and his lordship silently selected one and turned over the\\nleaves.\\n\\n\"Miss Clare,\" said the Lord Chancellor. \"Miss Ada Clare?\"\\n\\nMr. Kenge presented her, and his lordship begged her to sit down near\\nhim. That he admired her and was interested by her even I could see\\nin a moment. It touched me that the home of such a beautiful young\\ncreature should be represented by that dry, official place. The Lord\\nHigh Chancellor, at his best, appeared so poor a substitute for the\\nlove and pride of parents.\\n\\n\"The Jarndyce in question,\" said the Lord Chancellor, still turning\\nover leaves, \"is Jarndyce of Bleak House.\"\\n\\n\"Jarndyce of Bleak House, my lord,\" said Mr. Kenge.\\n\\n\"A dreary name,\" said the Lord Chancellor.\\n\\n\"But not a dreary place at present, my lord,\" said Mr. Kenge.\\n\\n\"And Bleak House,\" said his lordship, \"is in--\"\\n\\n\"Hertfordshire, my lord.\"\\n\\n\"Mr. Jarndyce of Bleak House is not married?\" said his lordship.\\n\\n\"He is not, my lord,\" said Mr. Kenge.\\n\\nA pause.\\n\\n\"Young Mr. Richard Carstone is present?\" said the Lord Chancellor,\\nglancing towards him.\\n\\nRichard bowed and stepped forward.\\n\\n\"Hum!\" said the Lord Chancellor, turning over more leaves.\\n\\n\"Mr. Jarndyce of Bleak House, my lord,\" Mr. Kenge observed in a low\\nvoice, \"if I may venture to remind your lordship, provides a suitable\\ncompanion for--\"\\n\\n\"For Mr. Richard Carstone?\" I thought (but I am not quite sure) I\\nheard his lordship say in an equally low voice and with a smile.\\n\\n\"For Miss Ada Clare. This is the young lady. Miss Summerson.\"\\n\\nHis lordship gave me an indulgent look and acknowledged my curtsy\\nvery graciously.\\n\\n\"Miss Summerson is not related to any party in the cause, I think?\"\\n\\n\"No, my lord.\"\\n\\nMr. Kenge leant over before it was quite said and whispered. His\\nlordship, with his eyes upon his papers, listened, nodded twice or\\nthrice, turned over more leaves, and did not look towards me again\\nuntil we were going away.\\n\\nMr. Kenge now retired, and Richard with him, to where I was, near the\\ndoor, leaving my pet (it is so natural to me that again I can\\'t help\\nit!) sitting near the Lord Chancellor, with whom his lordship spoke a\\nlittle part, asking her, as she told me afterwards, whether she had\\nwell reflected on the proposed arrangement, and if she thought she\\nwould be happy under the roof of Mr. Jarndyce of Bleak House, and why\\nshe thought so? Presently he rose courteously and released her, and\\nthen he spoke for a minute or two with Richard Carstone, not seated,\\nbut standing, and altogether with more ease and less ceremony, as if\\nhe still knew, though he WAS Lord Chancellor, how to go straight to\\nthe candour of a boy.\\n\\n\"Very well!\" said his lordship aloud. \"I shall make the order. Mr.\\nJarndyce of Bleak House has chosen, so far as I may judge,\" and this\\nwas when he looked at me, \"a very good companion for the young lady,\\nand the arrangement altogether seems the best of which the\\ncircumstances admit.\"\\n\\nHe dismissed us pleasantly, and we all went out, very much obliged to\\nhim for being so affable and polite, by which he had certainly lost\\nno dignity but seemed to us to have gained some.\\n\\nWhen we got under the colonnade, Mr. Kenge remembered that he must go\\nback for a moment to ask a question and left us in the fog, with the\\nLord Chancellor\\'s carriage and servants waiting for him to come out.\\n\\n\"Well!\" said Richard Carstone. \"THAT\\'S over! And where do we go next,\\nMiss Summerson?\"\\n\\n\"Don\\'t you know?\" I said.\\n\\n\"Not in the least,\" said he.\\n\\n\"And don\\'t YOU know, my love?\" I asked Ada.\\n\\n\"No!\" said she. \"Don\\'t you?\"\\n\\n\"Not at all!\" said I.\\n\\nWe looked at one another, half laughing at our being like the\\nchildren in the wood, when a curious little old woman in a squeezed\\nbonnet and carrying a reticule came curtsying and smiling up to us\\nwith an air of great ceremony.\\n\\n\"Oh!\" said she. \"The wards in Jarndyce! Ve-ry happy, I am sure, to\\nhave the honour! It is a good omen for youth, and hope, and beauty\\nwhen they find themselves in this place, and don\\'t know what\\'s to\\ncome of it.\"\\n\\n\"Mad!\" whispered Richard, not thinking she could hear him.\\n\\n\"Right! Mad, young gentleman,\" she returned so quickly that he was\\nquite abashed. \"I was a ward myself. I was not mad at that time,\"\\ncurtsying low and smiling between every little sentence. \"I had youth\\nand hope. I believe, beauty. It matters very little now. Neither of\\nthe three served or saved me. I have the honour to attend court\\nregularly. With my documents. I expect a judgment. Shortly. On the\\nDay of Judgment. I have discovered that the sixth seal mentioned in\\nthe Revelations is the Great Seal. It has been open a long time! Pray\\naccept my blessing.\"\\n\\nAs Ada was a little frightened, I said, to humour the poor old lady,\\nthat we were much obliged to her.\\n\\n\"Ye-es!\" she said mincingly. \"I imagine so. And here is Conversation\\nKenge. With HIS documents! How does your honourable worship do?\"\\n\\n\"Quite well, quite well! Now don\\'t be troublesome, that\\'s a good\\nsoul!\" said Mr. Kenge, leading the way back.\\n\\n\"By no means,\" said the poor old lady, keeping up with Ada and me.\\n\"Anything but troublesome. I shall confer estates on both--which is\\nnot being troublesome, I trust? I expect a judgment. Shortly. On the\\nDay of Judgment. This is a good omen for you. Accept my blessing!\"\\n\\nShe stopped at the bottom of the steep, broad flight of stairs; but\\nwe looked back as we went up, and she was still there, saying, still\\nwith a curtsy and a smile between every little sentence, \"Youth. And\\nhope. And beauty. And Chancery. And Conversation Kenge! Ha! Pray\\naccept my blessing!\"\\n\\n\\n\\nWe were to pass the night, Mr. Kenge told us when we arrived in his\\nroom, at Mrs. Jellyby\\'s; and then he turned to me and said he took it\\nfor granted I knew who Mrs. Jellyby was.\\n\\n\"I really don\\'t, sir,\" I returned. \"Perhaps Mr. Carstone--or Miss\\nClare--\"\\n\\nBut no, they knew nothing whatever about Mrs. Jellyby. \"In-deed! Mrs.\\nJellyby,\" said Mr. Kenge, standing with his back to the fire and\\ncasting his eyes over the dusty hearth-rug as if it were Mrs.\\nJellyby\\'s biography, \"is a lady of very remarkable strength of\\ncharacter who devotes herself entirely to the public. She has devoted\\nherself to an extensive variety of public subjects at various times\\nand is at present (until something else attracts her) devoted to the\\nsubject of Africa, with a view to the general cultivation of the\\ncoffee berry--AND the natives--and the happy settlement, on the banks\\nof the African rivers, of our superabundant home population. Mr.\\nJarndyce, who is desirous to aid any work that is considered likely\\nto be a good work and who is much sought after by philanthropists,\\nhas, I believe, a very high opinion of Mrs. Jellyby.\"\\n\\nMr. Kenge, adjusting his cravat, then looked at us.\\n\\n\"And Mr. Jellyby, sir?\" suggested Richard.\\n\\n\"Ah! Mr. Jellyby,\" said Mr. Kenge, \"is--a--I don\\'t know that I can\\ndescribe him to you better than by saying that he is the husband of\\nMrs. Jellyby.\"\\n\\n\"A nonentity, sir?\" said Richard with a droll look.\\n\\n\"I don\\'t say that,\" returned Mr. Kenge gravely. \"I can\\'t say that,\\nindeed, for I know nothing whatever OF Mr. Jellyby. I never, to my\\nknowledge, had the pleasure of seeing Mr. Jellyby. He may be a very\\nsuperior man, but he is, so to speak, merged--merged--in the more\\nshining qualities of his wife.\" Mr. Kenge proceeded to tell us that\\nas the road to Bleak House would have been very long, dark, and\\ntedious on such an evening, and as we had been travelling already,\\nMr. Jarndyce had himself proposed this arrangement. A carriage would\\nbe at Mrs. Jellyby\\'s to convey us out of town early in the forenoon\\nof to-morrow.\\n\\nHe then rang a little bell, and the young gentleman came in.\\nAddressing him by the name of Guppy, Mr. Kenge inquired whether Miss\\nSummerson\\'s boxes and the rest of the baggage had been \"sent round.\"\\nMr. Guppy said yes, they had been sent round, and a coach was waiting\\nto take us round too as soon as we pleased.\\n\\n\"Then it only remains,\" said Mr. Kenge, shaking hands with us, \"for\\nme to express my lively satisfaction in (good day, Miss Clare!) the\\narrangement this day concluded and my (GOOD-bye to you, Miss\\nSummerson!) lively hope that it will conduce to the happiness, the\\n(glad to have had the honour of making your acquaintance, Mr.\\nCarstone!) welfare, the advantage in all points of view, of all\\nconcerned! Guppy, see the party safely there.\"\\n\\n\"Where IS \\'there,\\' Mr. Guppy?\" said Richard as we went downstairs.\\n\\n\"No distance,\" said Mr. Guppy; \"round in Thavies Inn, you know.\"\\n\\n\"I can\\'t say I know where it is, for I come from Winchester and am\\nstrange in London.\"\\n\\n\"Only round the corner,\" said Mr. Guppy. \"We just twist up Chancery\\nLane, and cut along Holborn, and there we are in four minutes\\' time,\\nas near as a toucher. This is about a London particular NOW, ain\\'t\\nit, miss?\" He seemed quite delighted with it on my account.\\n\\n\"The fog is very dense indeed!\" said I.\\n\\n\"Not that it affects you, though, I\\'m sure,\" said Mr. Guppy, putting\\nup the steps. \"On the contrary, it seems to do you good, miss,\\njudging from your appearance.\"\\n\\nI knew he meant well in paying me this compliment, so I laughed at\\nmyself for blushing at it when he had shut the door and got upon the\\nbox; and we all three laughed and chatted about our inexperience and\\nthe strangeness of London until we turned up under an archway to our\\ndestination--a narrow street of high houses like an oblong cistern to\\nhold the fog. There was a confused little crowd of people,\\nprincipally children, gathered about the house at which we stopped,\\nwhich had a tarnished brass plate on the door with the inscription\\nJELLYBY.\\n\\n\"Don\\'t be frightened!\" said Mr. Guppy, looking in at the\\ncoach-window. \"One of the young Jellybys been and got his head\\nthrough the area railings!\"\\n\\n\"Oh, poor child,\" said I; \"let me out, if you please!\"\\n\\n\"Pray be careful of yourself, miss. The young Jellybys are always up\\nto something,\" said Mr. Guppy.\\n\\nI made my way to the poor child, who was one of the dirtiest little\\nunfortunates I ever saw, and found him very hot and frightened and\\ncrying loudly, fixed by the neck between two iron railings, while a\\nmilkman and a beadle, with the kindest intentions possible, were\\nendeavouring to drag him back by the legs, under a general impression\\nthat his skull was compressible by those means. As I found (after\\npacifying him) that he was a little boy with a naturally large head,\\nI thought that perhaps where his head could go, his body could\\nfollow, and mentioned that the best mode of extrication might be to\\npush him forward. This was so favourably received by the milkman and\\nbeadle that he would immediately have been pushed into the area if I\\nhad not held his pinafore while Richard and Mr. Guppy ran down\\nthrough the kitchen to catch him when he should be released. At last\\nhe was happily got down without any accident, and then he began to\\nbeat Mr. Guppy with a hoop-stick in quite a frantic manner.\\n\\nNobody had appeared belonging to the house except a person in\\npattens, who had been poking at the child from below with a broom; I\\ndon\\'t know with what object, and I don\\'t think she did. I therefore\\nsupposed that Mrs. Jellyby was not at home, and was quite surprised\\nwhen the person appeared in the passage without the pattens, and\\ngoing up to the back room on the first floor before Ada and me,\\nannounced us as, \"Them two young ladies, Missis Jellyby!\" We passed\\nseveral more children on the way up, whom it was difficult to avoid\\ntreading on in the dark; and as we came into Mrs. Jellyby\\'s presence,\\none of the poor little things fell downstairs--down a whole flight\\n(as it sounded to me), with a great noise.\\n\\nMrs. Jellyby, whose face reflected none of the uneasiness which we\\ncould not help showing in our own faces as the dear child\\'s head\\nrecorded its passage with a bump on every stair--Richard afterwards\\nsaid he counted seven, besides one for the landing--received us with\\nperfect equanimity. She was a pretty, very diminutive, plump woman of\\nfrom forty to fifty, with handsome eyes, though they had a curious\\nhabit of seeming to look a long way off. As if--I am quoting Richard\\nagain--they could see nothing nearer than Africa!\\n\\n\"I am very glad indeed,\" said Mrs. Jellyby in an agreeable voice, \"to\\nhave the pleasure of receiving you. I have a great respect for Mr.\\nJarndyce, and no one in whom he is interested can be an object of\\nindifference to me.\"\\n\\nWe expressed our acknowledgments and sat down behind the door, where\\nthere was a lame invalid of a sofa. Mrs. Jellyby had very good hair\\nbut was too much occupied with her African duties to brush it. The\\nshawl in which she had been loosely muffled dropped onto her chair\\nwhen she advanced to us; and as she turned to resume her seat, we\\ncould not help noticing that her dress didn\\'t nearly meet up the back\\nand that the open space was railed across with a lattice-work of\\nstay-lace--like a summer-house.\\n\\nThe room, which was strewn with papers and nearly filled by a great\\nwriting-table covered with similar litter, was, I must say, not only\\nvery untidy but very dirty. We were obliged to take notice of that\\nwith our sense of sight, even while, with our sense of hearing, we\\nfollowed the poor child who had tumbled downstairs: I think into the\\nback kitchen, where somebody seemed to stifle him.\\n\\nBut what principally struck us was a jaded and unhealthy-looking\\nthough by no means plain girl at the writing-table, who sat biting\\nthe feather of her pen and staring at us. I suppose nobody ever was\\nin such a state of ink. And from her tumbled hair to her pretty feet,\\nwhich were disfigured with frayed and broken satin slippers trodden\\ndown at heel, she really seemed to have no article of dress upon her,\\nfrom a pin upwards, that was in its proper condition or its right\\nplace.\\n\\n\"You find me, my dears,\" said Mrs. Jellyby, snuffing the two great\\noffice candles in tin candlesticks, which made the room taste\\nstrongly of hot tallow (the fire had gone out, and there was nothing\\nin the grate but ashes, a bundle of wood, and a poker), \"you find me,\\nmy dears, as usual, very busy; but that you will excuse. The African\\nproject at present employs my whole time. It involves me in\\ncorrespondence with public bodies and with private individuals\\nanxious for the welfare of their species all over the country. I am\\nhappy to say it is advancing. We hope by this time next year to have\\nfrom a hundred and fifty to two hundred healthy families cultivating\\ncoffee and educating the natives of Borrioboola-Gha, on the left bank\\nof the Niger.\"\\n\\nAs Ada said nothing, but looked at me, I said it must be very\\ngratifying.\\n\\n\"It IS gratifying,\" said Mrs. Jellyby. \"It involves the devotion of\\nall my energies, such as they are; but that is nothing, so that it\\nsucceeds; and I am more confident of success every day. Do you know,\\nMiss Summerson, I almost wonder that YOU never turned your thoughts\\nto Africa.\"\\n\\nThis application of the subject was really so unexpected to me that I\\nwas quite at a loss how to receive it. I hinted that the climate--\\n\\n\"The finest climate in the world!\" said Mrs. Jellyby.\\n\\n\"Indeed, ma\\'am?\"\\n\\n\"Certainly. With precaution,\" said Mrs. Jellyby. \"You may go into\\nHolborn, without precaution, and be run over. You may go into\\nHolborn, with precaution, and never be run over. Just so with\\nAfrica.\"\\n\\nI said, \"No doubt.\" I meant as to Holborn.\\n\\n\"If you would like,\" said Mrs. Jellyby, putting a number of papers\\ntowards us, \"to look over some remarks on that head, and on the\\ngeneral subject, which have been extensively circulated, while I\\nfinish a letter I am now dictating to my eldest daughter, who is my\\namanuensis--\"\\n\\nThe girl at the table left off biting her pen and made a return to\\nour recognition, which was half bashful and half sulky.\\n\\n\"--I shall then have finished for the present,\" proceeded Mrs.\\nJellyby with a sweet smile, \"though my work is never done. Where are\\nyou, Caddy?\"\\n\\n\"\\'Presents her compliments to Mr. Swallow, and begs--\\'\" said Caddy.\\n\\n\"\\'And begs,\\'\" said Mrs. Jellyby, dictating, \"\\'to inform him, in\\nreference to his letter of inquiry on the African project--\\' No,\\nPeepy! Not on my account!\"\\n\\nPeepy (so self-named) was the unfortunate child who had fallen\\ndownstairs, who now interrupted the correspondence by presenting\\nhimself, with a strip of plaster on his forehead, to exhibit his\\nwounded knees, in which Ada and I did not know which to pity\\nmost--the bruises or the dirt. Mrs. Jellyby merely added, with the\\nserene composure with which she said everything, \"Go along, you\\nnaughty Peepy!\" and fixed her fine eyes on Africa again.\\n\\nHowever, as she at once proceeded with her dictation, and as I\\ninterrupted nothing by doing it, I ventured quietly to stop poor\\nPeepy as he was going out and to take him up to nurse. He looked very\\nmuch astonished at it and at Ada\\'s kissing him, but soon fell fast\\nasleep in my arms, sobbing at longer and longer intervals, until he\\nwas quiet. I was so occupied with Peepy that I lost the letter in\\ndetail, though I derived such a general impression from it of the\\nmomentous importance of Africa, and the utter insignificance of all\\nother places and things, that I felt quite ashamed to have thought so\\nlittle about it.\\n\\n\"Six o\\'clock!\" said Mrs. Jellyby. \"And our dinner hour is nominally\\n(for we dine at all hours) five! Caddy, show Miss Clare and Miss\\nSummerson their rooms. You will like to make some change, perhaps?\\nYou will excuse me, I know, being so much occupied. Oh, that very bad\\nchild! Pray put him down, Miss Summerson!\"\\n\\nI begged permission to retain him, truly saying that he was not at\\nall troublesome, and carried him upstairs and laid him on my bed. Ada\\nand I had two upper rooms with a door of communication between. They\\nwere excessively bare and disorderly, and the curtain to my window\\nwas fastened up with a fork.\\n\\n\"You would like some hot water, wouldn\\'t you?\" said Miss Jellyby,\\nlooking round for a jug with a handle to it, but looking in vain.\\n\\n\"If it is not being troublesome,\" said we.\\n\\n\"Oh, it\\'s not the trouble,\" returned Miss Jellyby; \"the question is,\\nif there IS any.\"\\n\\nThe evening was so very cold and the rooms had such a marshy smell\\nthat I must confess it was a little miserable, and Ada was half\\ncrying. We soon laughed, however, and were busily unpacking when Miss\\nJellyby came back to say that she was sorry there was no hot water,\\nbut they couldn\\'t find the kettle, and the boiler was out of order.\\n\\nWe begged her not to mention it and made all the haste we could to\\nget down to the fire again. But all the little children had come up\\nto the landing outside to look at the phenomenon of Peepy lying on my\\nbed, and our attention was distracted by the constant apparition of\\nnoses and fingers in situations of danger between the hinges of the\\ndoors. It was impossible to shut the door of either room, for my\\nlock, with no knob to it, looked as if it wanted to be wound up; and\\nthough the handle of Ada\\'s went round and round with the greatest\\nsmoothness, it was attended with no effect whatever on the door.\\nTherefore I proposed to the children that they should come in and be\\nvery good at my table, and I would tell them the story of Little Red\\nRiding Hood while I dressed; which they did, and were as quiet as\\nmice, including Peepy, who awoke opportunely before the appearance of\\nthe wolf.\\n\\nWhen we went downstairs we found a mug with \"A Present from Tunbridge\\nWells\" on it lighted up in the staircase window with a floating wick,\\nand a young woman, with a swelled face bound up in a flannel bandage\\nblowing the fire of the drawing-room (now connected by an open door\\nwith Mrs. Jellyby\\'s room) and choking dreadfully. It smoked to that\\ndegree, in short, that we all sat coughing and crying with the\\nwindows open for half an hour, during which Mrs. Jellyby, with the\\nsame sweetness of temper, directed letters about Africa. Her being so\\nemployed was, I must say, a great relief to me, for Richard told us\\nthat he had washed his hands in a pie-dish and that they had found\\nthe kettle on his dressing-table, and he made Ada laugh so that they\\nmade me laugh in the most ridiculous manner.\\n\\nSoon after seven o\\'clock we went down to dinner, carefully, by Mrs.\\nJellyby\\'s advice, for the stair-carpets, besides being very deficient\\nin stair-wires, were so torn as to be absolute traps. We had a fine\\ncod-fish, a piece of roast beef, a dish of cutlets, and a pudding; an\\nexcellent dinner, if it had had any cooking to speak of, but it was\\nalmost raw. The young woman with the flannel bandage waited, and\\ndropped everything on the table wherever it happened to go, and never\\nmoved it again until she put it on the stairs. The person I had seen\\nin pattens, who I suppose to have been the cook, frequently came and\\nskirmished with her at the door, and there appeared to be ill will\\nbetween them.\\n\\nAll through dinner--which was long, in consequence of such accidents\\nas the dish of potatoes being mislaid in the coal skuttle and the\\nhandle of the corkscrew coming off and striking the young woman in\\nthe chin--Mrs. Jellyby preserved the evenness of her disposition. She\\ntold us a great deal that was interesting about Borrioboola-Gha and\\nthe natives, and received so many letters that Richard, who sat by\\nher, saw four envelopes in the gravy at once. Some of the letters\\nwere proceedings of ladies\\' committees or resolutions of ladies\\'\\nmeetings, which she read to us; others were applications from people\\nexcited in various ways about the cultivation of coffee, and natives;\\nothers required answers, and these she sent her eldest daughter from\\nthe table three or four times to write. She was full of business and\\nundoubtedly was, as she had told us, devoted to the cause.\\n\\nI was a little curious to know who a mild bald gentleman in\\nspectacles was, who dropped into a vacant chair (there was no top or\\nbottom in particular) after the fish was taken away and seemed\\npassively to submit himself to Borrioboola-Gha but not to be actively\\ninterested in that settlement. As he never spoke a word, he might\\nhave been a native but for his complexion. It was not until we left\\nthe table and he remained alone with Richard that the possibility of\\nhis being Mr. Jellyby ever entered my head. But he WAS Mr. Jellyby;\\nand a loquacious young man called Mr. Quale, with large shining knobs\\nfor temples and his hair all brushed to the back of his head, who\\ncame in the evening, and told Ada he was a philanthropist, also\\ninformed her that he called the matrimonial alliance of Mrs. Jellyby\\nwith Mr. Jellyby the union of mind and matter.\\n\\nThis young man, besides having a great deal to say for himself about\\nAfrica and a project of his for teaching the coffee colonists to\\nteach the natives to turn piano-forte legs and establish an export\\ntrade, delighted in drawing Mrs. Jellyby out by saying, \"I believe\\nnow, Mrs. Jellyby, you have received as many as from one hundred and\\nfifty to two hundred letters respecting Africa in a single day, have\\nyou not?\" or, \"If my memory does not deceive me, Mrs. Jellyby, you\\nonce mentioned that you had sent off five thousand circulars from one\\npost-office at one time?\"--always repeating Mrs. Jellyby\\'s answer to\\nus like an interpreter. During the whole evening, Mr. Jellyby sat in\\na corner with his head against the wall as if he were subject to low\\nspirits. It seemed that he had several times opened his mouth when\\nalone with Richard after dinner, as if he had something on his mind,\\nbut had always shut it again, to Richard\\'s extreme confusion, without\\nsaying anything.\\n\\nMrs. Jellyby, sitting in quite a nest of waste paper, drank coffee\\nall the evening and dictated at intervals to her eldest daughter. She\\nalso held a discussion with Mr. Quale, of which the subject seemed to\\nbe--if I understood it--the brotherhood of humanity, and gave\\nutterance to some beautiful sentiments. I was not so attentive an\\nauditor as I might have wished to be, however, for Peepy and the\\nother children came flocking about Ada and me in a corner of the\\ndrawing-room to ask for another story; so we sat down among them and\\ntold them in whispers \"Puss in Boots\" and I don\\'t know what else\\nuntil Mrs. Jellyby, accidentally remembering them, sent them to bed.\\nAs Peepy cried for me to take him to bed, I carried him upstairs,\\nwhere the young woman with the flannel bandage charged into the midst\\nof the little family like a dragon and overturned them into cribs.\\n\\nAfter that I occupied myself in making our room a little tidy and in\\ncoaxing a very cross fire that had been lighted to burn, which at\\nlast it did, quite brightly. On my return downstairs, I felt that\\nMrs. Jellyby looked down upon me rather for being so frivolous, and I\\nwas sorry for it, though at the same time I knew that I had no higher\\npretensions.\\n\\nIt was nearly midnight before we found an opportunity of going to\\nbed, and even then we left Mrs. Jellyby among her papers drinking\\ncoffee and Miss Jellyby biting the feather of her pen.\\n\\n\"What a strange house!\" said Ada when we got upstairs. \"How curious\\nof my cousin Jarndyce to send us here!\"\\n\\n\"My love,\" said I, \"it quite confuses me. I want to understand it,\\nand I can\\'t understand it at all.\"\\n\\n\"What?\" asked Ada with her pretty smile.\\n\\n\"All this, my dear,\" said I. \"It MUST be very good of Mrs. Jellyby to\\ntake such pains about a scheme for the benefit of natives--and\\nyet--Peepy and the housekeeping!\"\\n\\nAda laughed and put her arm about my neck as I stood looking at the\\nfire, and told me I was a quiet, dear, good creature and had won her\\nheart. \"You are so thoughtful, Esther,\" she said, \"and yet so\\ncheerful! And you do so much, so unpretendingly! You would make a\\nhome out of even this house.\"\\n\\nMy simple darling! She was quite unconscious that she only praised\\nherself and that it was in the goodness of her own heart that she\\nmade so much of me!\\n\\n\"May I ask you a question?\" said I when we had sat before the fire a\\nlittle while.\\n\\n\"Five hundred,\" said Ada.\\n\\n\"Your cousin, Mr. Jarndyce. I owe so much to him. Would you mind\\ndescribing him to me?\"\\n\\nShaking her golden hair, Ada turned her eyes upon me with such\\nlaughing wonder that I was full of wonder too, partly at her beauty,\\npartly at her surprise.\\n\\n\"Esther!\" she cried.\\n\\n\"My dear!\"\\n\\n\"You want a description of my cousin Jarndyce?\"\\n\\n\"My dear, I never saw him.\"\\n\\n\"And I never saw him!\" returned Ada.\\n\\nWell, to be sure!\\n\\nNo, she had never seen him. Young as she was when her mama died, she\\nremembered how the tears would come into her eyes when she spoke of\\nhim and of the noble generosity of his character, which she had said\\nwas to be trusted above all earthly things; and Ada trusted it. Her\\ncousin Jarndyce had written to her a few months ago--\"a plain, honest\\nletter,\" Ada said--proposing the arrangement we were now to enter on\\nand telling her that \"in time it might heal some of the wounds made\\nby the miserable Chancery suit.\" She had replied, gratefully\\naccepting his proposal. Richard had received a similar letter and had\\nmade a similar response. He HAD seen Mr. Jarndyce once, but only\\nonce, five years ago, at Winchester school. He had told Ada, when\\nthey were leaning on the screen before the fire where I found them,\\nthat he recollected him as \"a bluff, rosy fellow.\" This was the\\nutmost description Ada could give me.\\n\\nIt set me thinking so that when Ada was asleep, I still remained\\nbefore the fire, wondering and wondering about Bleak House, and\\nwondering and wondering that yesterday morning should seem so long\\nago. I don\\'t know where my thoughts had wandered when they were\\nrecalled by a tap at the door.\\n\\nI opened it softly and found Miss Jellyby shivering there with a\\nbroken candle in a broken candlestick in one hand and an egg-cup in\\nthe other.\\n\\n\"Good night!\" she said very sulkily.\\n\\n\"Good night!\" said I.\\n\\n\"May I come in?\" she shortly and unexpectedly asked me in the same\\nsulky way.\\n\\n\"Certainly,\" said I. \"Don\\'t wake Miss Clare.\"\\n\\nShe would not sit down, but stood by the fire dipping her inky middle\\nfinger in the egg-cup, which contained vinegar, and smearing it over\\nthe ink stains on her face, frowning the whole time and looking very\\ngloomy.\\n\\n\"I wish Africa was dead!\" she said on a sudden.\\n\\nI was going to remonstrate.\\n\\n\"I do!\" she said \"Don\\'t talk to me, Miss Summerson. I hate it and\\ndetest it. It\\'s a beast!\"\\n\\nI told her she was tired, and I was sorry. I put my hand upon her\\nhead, and touched her forehead, and said it was hot now but would be\\ncool to-morrow. She still stood pouting and frowning at me, but\\npresently put down her egg-cup and turned softly towards the bed\\nwhere Ada lay.\\n\\n\"She is very pretty!\" she said with the same knitted brow and in the\\nsame uncivil manner.\\n\\nI assented with a smile.\\n\\n\"An orphan. Ain\\'t she?\"\\n\\n\"Yes.\"\\n\\n\"But knows a quantity, I suppose? Can dance, and play music, and\\nsing? She can talk French, I suppose, and do geography, and globes,\\nand needlework, and everything?\"\\n\\n\"No doubt,\" said I.\\n\\n\"I can\\'t,\" she returned. \"I can\\'t do anything hardly, except write.\\nI\\'m always writing for Ma. I wonder you two were not ashamed of\\nyourselves to come in this afternoon and see me able to do nothing\\nelse. It was like your ill nature. Yet you think yourselves very\\nfine, I dare say!\"\\n\\nI could see that the poor girl was near crying, and I resumed my\\nchair without speaking and looked at her (I hope) as mildly as I felt\\ntowards her.\\n\\n\"It\\'s disgraceful,\" she said. \"You know it is. The whole house is\\ndisgraceful. The children are disgraceful. I\\'M disgraceful. Pa\\'s\\nmiserable, and no wonder! Priscilla drinks--she\\'s always drinking.\\nIt\\'s a great shame and a great story of you if you say you didn\\'t\\nsmell her to-day. It was as bad as a public-house, waiting at dinner;\\nyou know it was!\"\\n\\n\"My dear, I don\\'t know it,\" said I.\\n\\n\"You do,\" she said very shortly. \"You shan\\'t say you don\\'t. You do!\"\\n\\n\"Oh, my dear!\" said I. \"If you won\\'t let me speak--\"\\n\\n\"You\\'re speaking now. You know you are. Don\\'t tell stories, Miss\\nSummerson.\"\\n\\n\"My dear,\" said I, \"as long as you won\\'t hear me out--\"\\n\\n\"I don\\'t want to hear you out.\"\\n\\n\"Oh, yes, I think you do,\" said I, \"because that would be so very\\nunreasonable. I did not know what you tell me because the servant did\\nnot come near me at dinner; but I don\\'t doubt what you tell me, and I\\nam sorry to hear it.\"\\n\\n\"You needn\\'t make a merit of that,\" said she.\\n\\n\"No, my dear,\" said I. \"That would be very foolish.\"\\n\\nShe was still standing by the bed, and now stooped down (but still\\nwith the same discontented face) and kissed Ada. That done, she came\\nsoftly back and stood by the side of my chair. Her bosom was heaving\\nin a distressful manner that I greatly pitied, but I thought it\\nbetter not to speak.\\n\\n\"I wish I was dead!\" she broke out. \"I wish we were all dead. It\\nwould be a great deal better for us.\"\\n\\nIn a moment afterwards, she knelt on the ground at my side, hid her\\nface in my dress, passionately begged my pardon, and wept. I\\ncomforted her and would have raised her, but she cried no, no; she\\nwanted to stay there!\\n\\n\"You used to teach girls,\" she said, \"If you could only have taught\\nme, I could have learnt from you! I am so very miserable, and I like\\nyou so much!\"\\n\\nI could not persuade her to sit by me or to do anything but move a\\nragged stool to where she was kneeling, and take that, and still hold\\nmy dress in the same manner. By degrees the poor tired girl fell\\nasleep, and then I contrived to raise her head so that it should rest\\non my lap, and to cover us both with shawls. The fire went out, and\\nall night long she slumbered thus before the ashy grate. At first I\\nwas painfully awake and vainly tried to lose myself, with my eyes\\nclosed, among the scenes of the day. At length, by slow degrees, they\\nbecame indistinct and mingled. I began to lose the identity of the\\nsleeper resting on me. Now it was Ada, now one of my old Reading\\nfriends from whom I could not believe I had so recently parted. Now\\nit was the little mad woman worn out with curtsying and smiling, now\\nsome one in authority at Bleak House. Lastly, it was no one, and I\\nwas no one.\\n\\nThe purblind day was feebly struggling with the fog when I opened my\\neyes to encounter those of a dirty-faced little spectre fixed upon\\nme. Peepy had scaled his crib, and crept down in his bed-gown and\\ncap, and was so cold that his teeth were chattering as if he had cut\\nthem all.\\n\\n\\n\\n', 'chapter_summary': 'The scene opens in London on a foggy, smoggy day. The High Court of Chancery is in session, and it appears that the fog has settled thickest on this part of London. This is where the legal suit of Jarndyce and Jarndyce is being argued. A little mad old woman , and a man from Shropshire are in attendance. A \"sallow prisoner\" is brought forward. Mr. Tangle, a lawyer, speaks with the Lord High Chancellor, and the matter of the two young wards in Jarndyce is discussed. This matter will come up before the court tomorrow. The scene changes in Chapter 2 to Chesney Wold, a stately home in Lincolnshire. Here the weather is also bad, but it is constant rain rather than fog. The lady of the manor, Lady Dedlock, is bored to death. She had been in London, and has come back to the country seat before leaving for Paris in a few days. Lady Dedlock is introduced to us as a very beautiful middle-aged society lady, her charms undimmed by time. She is exceedingly dignified and self-controlled, but her \"caprices,\" which she tries to hide, are known to her servants and tradesmen. She is the wife of Sir Leicester Dedlock, a baronet, who has married somehat beneath him. It is clear that Lady Dedlock has brought neither an aristocratic lineage or a fortune to the marriage. It is also clear that Sir Leicester has such a great amount of both of those things, and loves her so dearly, that it matters not to him. Mr. Tulkinghorn, the family solicitor, has come down to Chesney Wold to discuss the Jarndyce case, in which Lady Dedlock has some slight interest. He is a secretive, enigmatic man, of the most controlled and logical character. He brings many legal papers with him, and Lady Dedlock seems to take an interest in the handwriting on one of them. She asks whose writing it is, but Mr. Tulkinghorn cannot answer her. She becomes faint and must be taken to her room. In Chapter 3, Esther Summerson\\'s life story is told. She has been materially provided for but emotionally neglected by her \"godmother\" in the town of Windsor. When Esther is about fourteen, her godmother dies, and Esther is sent to Greenleaf school. Through Mr. Kenge, John Jarndyce\\'s solicitor, who comes to see Esther after her godmother\\'s death, she learns her benefactor is Mr. Jarndyce. She has never seen him, but he appears, unbeknownst to her until years later, in the carriage that takes her to Greenleaf school. She is sent there after her godmother\\'s death, and passes six happy years there, being taught by the Misses Donny. Her accounts are paid by her unknown benefactor all the while. When she is older she becomes a teacher of the other girls there, and inspires great affection in her students. When she has grown old and educated enough to leave Greenleaf school, she is asked to serve in her benefactor\\'s house, Bleak House. She is brought to Chancery Court to meet Ada Clare and Richard Carstone, two wards in the Jarndyce suit, who are also under the guardianship of Mr. Jarndyce. Esther is meant to be Ada\\'s lady companion. As they leave the court, they meet Miss Flite, who introduces herself. They learn she is also a suitor in Chancery, and observe that she is poor, eccentric, and perhaps a little mad. In Chapter 4, the three young people are sent to stay the night at the Jellyby household. Mrs. Jellyby is a philanthropic lady who neglects her large and chaotic household in favor of writing long letters, dictated to her eldest daughter Caddy, about the social conditions in places in Africa. Caddy, an overworked waif, clings to Esther and becomes her friend, as does the youngest neglected child, Peepy.'}\n"

      "{'document': 'The structure of the armed forces is based on the Total Force concept, which recognizes that all elements of the structure—active duty military personnel, reservists, defense contractors, host nation military and civilian personnel, and DOD federal civilian employees—contribute to national defense. In recent years, federal civilian personnel have deployed along with military personnel to participate in Operations Joint Endeavor, conducted in the countries of Bosnia-Herzegovina, Croatia, and Hungary; Joint Guardian, in Kosovo; and Desert Storm, in Southwest Asia. Further, since the beginning of the Global War on Terrorism, the role of DOD’s federal civilian personnel has expanded to include participation in combat support functions in Operations Enduring Freedom and Iraqi Freedom. DOD relies on the federal civilian personnel it deploys to support a range of essential missions, including intelligence collection, criminal investigations, and weapon systems acquisition and maintenance. To ensure that its federal civilian employees will deploy to combat zones and perform critical combat support functions in theater, DOD established the emergency-essential program in 1985. Under this program, DOD designates as “emergency-essential” those civilian employees whose positions are required to ensure the success of combat operations or the availability of combat-essential systems. DOD can deploy federal civilian employees either on a voluntary or involuntary basis to accomplish the DOD mission. DOD has established force health protection and surveillance policies aimed at assessing and reducing or preventing health risks for its deployed federal civilian personnel; however, the department lacks procedures to ensure the components’ full implementation of its policies. In reviewing DOD federal civilian deployment records and other electronic documentation at selected component locations, we found that these components lacked documentation to show that they had fully complied with DOD’s force health protection and surveillance policy requirements for some federal civilian personnel who deployed to Afghanistan and Iraq. As a larger issue, DOD’s policies did not require the centralized collection of data on the identity of its deployed civilians, their movements in theater, or their health status, further hindering its efforts to assess the overall effectiveness of its force health protection and surveillance capabilities. In August 2006, DOD issued a revised policy (to be effective in December 2006) that outlines procedures to address its lack of centralized deployment and health-related data. However, the procedures are not comprehensive enough to ensure that DOD will be sufficiently informed of the extent to which its components fully comply with its requirements to monitor the health of deployed federal civilians. The DOD components included in our review lacked documentation to show that they always implemented force health protection and surveillance requirements for deployed federal civilians. These requirements include completing (1) pre-deployment health assessments to ensure that only medically fit personnel deploy outside of the United States as part of a contingency or combat operation; (2) pre-deployment immunizations to address possible health threats in deployment locations; (3) pre-deployment medical screenings for tuberculosis and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV); and (4) post-deployment health assessments to document current health status, experiences, environmental exposures, and health concerns related to their work while deployed. DOD’s force health protection and surveillance policies require the components to assess the medical condition of federal civilians to ensure that only medically fit personnel deploy outside of the United States as part of a contingency or combat operation. The policies stipulate that all deploying civilian personnel are to complete pre-deployment health assessment forms within 30 days of their deployments, and health care providers are to review the assessments to confirm the civilians’ health readiness status and identify any needs for additional clinical evaluations prior to their deployments. While the components that we included in our review had procedures in place that would enable them to implement DOD’s pre-deployment health assessment policies, it was not clear to what extent they had done so. Our review of deployment records and other documentation at the selected component locations found that these components lacked documentation to show that some federal civilian personnel who deployed to Afghanistan and Iraq had received the required pre-deployment health assessments. For those deployed federal civilians in our review, we found that, overall, a small number of deployment records (52 out of 3,771) were missing documentation to show that they had received their pre-deployment health assessments, as reflected in table 1. As shown in table 1, the federal civilian deployment records we included in our review showed wide variation by location regarding documentation of pre-deployment health assessments, ranging from less than 1 percent to more than 90 percent. On an aggregate component-level basis, at the Navy location in our review, we found that documentation was missing for 19 of the 52 records in our review. At the Air Force locations, documentation was missing for 29 of the 37 records in our review. In contrast, all three Army locations had hard copy or electronic records which indicated that almost all of their federal deployed civilians had received pre-deployment health assessments. In addition to completing pre-deployment health assessment forms, DOD’s force health protection and surveillance policies stipulate that all DOD deploying federal civilians receive theater-specific immunizations to address possible health threats in deployment locations. Immunizations required for all civilian personnel who deploy to Afghanistan and Iraq include: hepatitis A (two-shot series); tetanus-diphtheria (within 10 years of deployment); smallpox (within 5 years of deployment); typhoid; and influenza (within the last 12 months of deployment). As reflected in table 2, based on the deployment records maintained by the components at locations included in our review, the overall number of federal civilian deployment records lacking documentation of only one of the required immunizations for deployment to Afghanistan and Iraq was 285 out of 3,771. However, 3,313 of the records we reviewed were missing documentation of two or more immunizations. At the Army’s Fort Bliss, our review of its electronic deployment data determined that none of its deployed federal civilians had documentation to show that they had received immunizations. Officials at this location stated that they believed some immunizations had been given; however, they could not provide documentation as evidence of this. DOD policies require deploying federal civilians to receive certain screenings, such as for tuberculosis and HIV. Table 3 indicates that 55 of the 3,771 federal civilian deployment records included in our review were lacking documentation of the required tuberculosis screening; and approximately 35 were lacking documentation of HIV screenings prior to deployment. DOD’s force health protection and surveillance policies also require returning DOD federal civilian personnel to undergo post-deployment health assessments to document current health status, experiences, environmental exposures, and health concerns related to their work while deployed. The post-deployment process begins within 5 days of civilians’ redeployment from the theater to their home or demobilization processing stations. DOD’s policies require civilian personnel to complete a post- deployment assessment that includes questions on health and exposure concerns. A health care provider is to review each assessment and recommend additional clinical evaluation or treatment as needed. As reflected in table 4, our review of deployment records at the selected component locations found that these components lacked documentation to show that most deployed federal civilians (3,525 out of 3,771) who deployed to Afghanistan and Iraq had received the required post- deployment health assessments upon their return to the United States. Federal civilian deployment records lacking evidence of post-deployment health assessments ranged from 3 at the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers Transatlantic Programs Center and Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, respectively, to 2,977 at Fort Bliss. Beyond the aforementioned weaknesses found in the selected components’ implementation of force health protection and surveillance requirements for deploying federal civilians, as a larger issue, DOD lacks comprehensive, centralized data that would enable it to readily identify its deployed civilians, track their movements in theater, or monitor their health status, further hindering efforts to assess the overall effectiveness of its force health protection and surveillance capabilities. The Defense Manpower Data Center (DMDC) is responsible for maintaining the department’s centralized system that currently collects location-specific deployment information for military servicemembers, such as grid coordinates, latitude/longitude coordinates, or geographic location codes. However, DOD has not taken steps to similarly maintain centralized data on its deployed federal civilians. In addition, DOD had not provided guidance that would require its components to track and report data on the locations and movements of DOD federal civilian personnel in theaters of operations. In the absence of such a requirement, each DOD component collected and reported aggregated data that identified the total number of DOD federal civilian personnel in a theater of operations, but each lacked the ability to gather, analyze, and report information that could be used to specifically identify individuals at risk for occupational and environmental exposures during deployments. In previously reporting on the military services’ implementation of DOD’s force health protection and surveillance policies in 2003, we highlighted the importance of knowing the identity of servicemembers who deployed during a given operation and of tracking their movements within the theater of operations as major elements of a military medical surveillance system. We further noted the Institute of Medicine’s finding that documentation on the location of units and individuals during a given deployment is important for epidemiological studies and appropriate medical care during and after deployments. For example, this information allows epidemiologists to study the incidences of disease patterns across populations of deployed servicemembers who may have been exposed to diseases and hazards within the theater, and health care professionals to treat their medical problems appropriately. Without location-specific information for all of its deployed federal civilians and centralized data in its department-level system, DOD limits its ability to ensure that sufficient and appropriate consideration will also be given to addressing the health care concerns of these individuals. DOD also had not provided guidance to the components that would require them to forward completed deployment health assessments for all federal civilians to the Army Medical Surveillance Activity (AMSA), where these assessments are suppose to be archived in the Defense Medical Surveillance System (DMSS), integrated with other historical and current data on personnel and deployments, and used to monitor the health of personnel who participate in deployments. The overall success of deployment force protection and surveillance efforts, in large measure, depends on the completeness of health assessment data. The lack of such data may hamper DOD’s ability to intervene in a timely manner to address health care problems that may arise from DOD federal civilian deployments to overseas locations in support of contingency operations. With increases in the department’s use of federal civilian personnel to support military operations, DOD officials have recognized the need for more complete and centralized location-specific deployment information and deployment-related health information on its deployed federal civilians. In this regard, in August 2006, the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Personnel and Readiness issued revised policy and program guidance that generally addressed the shortcomings in DOD’s force health protection and surveillance capabilities. The revised policy and guidance, scheduled to become effective in December 2006, require the components within 3 years, to electronically report (at least weekly) to DMDC, location-specific data for all deployed personnel, including federal civilians. In addition, the policy and guidance require the components to submit all completed health assessment forms to the AMSA for inclusion in DMSS. Nonetheless, DOD’s new policy is not comprehensive enough to ensure that the department will be sufficiently informed of the extent to which its components are complying with existing health protection requirements for its deployed federal civilians. Although the policy requires DOD components to report certain location-specific and health data for all of their deployed personnel, including federal civilians, it does not establish an oversight and quality assurance mechanism for assessing and ensuring the full implementation of the force health protection and surveillance requirements by all DOD components that our prior work has identified as essential in providing care to military personnel. In a September 2003 report on the Army’s and the Air Force’s compliance with force health protection policy for servicemembers, we noted that neither of the military services had fully complied with DOD’s force health protection and surveillance policies for many active duty servicemembers, including the policies requiring that servicemembers be assessed before and after deploying overseas and receive certain immunizations. We further noted that DOD, at that time, did not have an effective quality assurance program to provide oversight of, and ensure compliance with, the department’s force health protection and surveillance requirements, and that the lack of such a system was a major cause of the high rate of noncompliance that we identified at the units we visited. In response to a legislative mandate and our recommendation, DOD established an oversight mechanism to evaluate the success of its force health protection and surveillance policies in ensuring that servicemembers received pre- and post-deployment medical examinations and that record-keeping requirements were met. This oversight mechanism included (1) periodic site visits jointly conducted with staff from the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Health Affairs and staff from the military services to assess compliance with the deployment health requirements, (2) periodic reports from the services on their quality assurance programs, and (3) periodic reports from AMSA on health assessment data maintained in the centralized database. Until the department provides a similar oversight and quality assurance mechanism for its deployed federal civilians, it will not be effectively positioned to ensure compliance with its policies, or ensure the health care and protection of these individuals as they continue to support contingency operations. DOD has established medical treatment policies that cover its federal civilians while they are deployed to support contingency operations in Afghanistan and Iraq, and available workers’ compensation claims we reviewed confirmed that those deployed federal civilians received care consistent with the policies. These policies state that DOD federal civilians who require treatment for injuries or diseases sustained during overseas hostilities may be provided care under the DOD military health system. Thus, DOD’s deployed federal civilians may receive care through the military’s treatment facilities. As shown in figure 1, DOD’s military health system provides four levels of medical care to personnel who are injured or become ill while deployed. Specifically, medical treatment during a military contingency begins with level one care, which consists of basic first aid and emergency care at a unit in the theater of operation. The treatment then moves to a second level of care, where, at an Aid station, injured or ill personnel are examined and evaluated to determine their priority for continued movement outside of the theater of operation and to the next (third) level of care. At the third level, injured or ill personnel are treated in a medical installation staffed and equipped for resuscitation, surgery, and postoperative care. Finally, at the fourth level of care, which occurs far from the theater of operation, injured or ill personnel are treated in a hospital staffed and equipped for definitive care. Injured or ill DOD federal civilians deployed in support of contingency operations in Afghanistan and Iraq who require level four medical care are transported to DOD’s Regional Medical Center in Landstuhl, Germany. Injured or ill DOD federal civilians who cannot be returned to duty in theater are evacuated to the United States for continuation of medical care. In these cases (or where previously deployed federal civilians later identify injuries or diseases and subsequently request medical treatment), DOD’s policy provides for its federal civilians who require treatment for deployment-related injuries or occupational illnesses to receive medical care through either the military’s medical treatment facilities or civilian facilities. The policy stipulates that federal civilians who are injured or become ill as a result of their deployment must file a Federal Employees’ Compensation Act (FECA) claim with DOD, which then files a claim with the Department of Labor’s Office of Workers’ Compensation Programs (OWCP). The Department of Labor’s OWCP is responsible for making a decision to award or deny medical benefits. OWCP must establish—based on evidence provided by the DOD civilian—that the employee is eligible for workers’ compensation benefits due to the injury or disease for which the benefits are claimed. To obtain benefits under FECA, DOD federal civilians must show that (1) they were employed by the U.S. government, (2) they were injured (exposed) in the workplace, (3) they have filed a claim in a timely manner, (4) they have a disabling medical condition, and (5) there is a causal link between their medical condition and the injury or exposure. Three avenues of appeal are provided for DOD federal civilians in the event that the initial claim is denied: (1) reconsideration by an OWCP claims examiner, (2) a hearing or review of the written record by OWCP’s Branch of Hearings and Review, and (3) a review by the Employees’ Compensation Appeals Board. DOD’s medical treatment process and the OWCP’s claims process are shown in figure 2. Overall, the claims we reviewed showed that the DOD federal civilians who sustained injuries or diseases while deployed had received care that was consistent with DOD’s medical treatment policies. Specifically, in reviewing a sample of seven workers’ compensation claims (out of a universe of 83) filed under the Federal Employees’ Compensation Act by DOD federal civilians who deployed to Iraq, we found that in three cases where care was initiated in theater the affected federal civilians had received treatment in accordance with DOD’s policies. For example, in one case, a deployed federal civilian was treated for traumatic injuries at a hospital outside of the theater of operation and could not return to duty in theater because of the severity of the injuries sustained. The civilian was evacuated to the United States and received medical care through several of the military’s medical treatment facilities as well as through a civilian facility. Further, in all seven claims that we reviewed, DOD federal civilians who requested medical care after returning to the United States, had, in accordance with DOD’s policy, received initial medical examinations and/or treatment for their deployment-related injuries or illnesses and diseases through either military or civilian treatment facilities. While OWCP has primary responsibility for processing and approving all FECA claims for medical benefits, as noted earlier, the scope of our review did not include assessing actions taken by the Department of Labor’s OWCP in further processing workers’ compensation claims for injured or ill civilians and authorizing continuation of medical care once their claims were submitted for review. DOD provides a number of special pays and benefits to its federal civilian personnel who deploy in support of contingency operations, which are generally different in type and in amount from those provided to deployed military personnel. Both groups receive special pays, but the types and amounts differ. In our modeled scenarios, the overall amounts of compensation, which include special pays, were higher for DOD federal civilian personnel than for military personnel. DOD federal civilian personnel also receive different types and amounts of disability benefits, depending on specific program provisions and individual circumstances. Further, survivors of deceased DOD federal civilian and military personnel generally receive comparable types of cash survivor benefits—lump sum, recurring, or both—but benefit amounts differ for the two groups. Survivors of DOD federal civilian personnel, however, almost always receive lower noncash benefits than military personnel. DOD federal civilian and military personnel are both eligible to receive special pays to compensate them for the conditions of deployment. As shown in table 5, some of the types of special pays are similar for both DOD federal civilian and military personnel, although the amounts paid to each group differ. Other special pays were unique to each group. DOD federal civilian and military personnel deployed to posts with unusually difficult or unhealthful conditions or severe physical hardships are authorized a similar type of post (hardship) differential. In addition, danger pay is granted to both groups serving at a post where civil insurrection, civil war, or war-like conditions exist. In this context, DOD federal civilian personnel who are deployed to Afghanistan and Iraq are eligible to receive post (hardship) differential and danger pay, each equivalent to 35 percent of their base salaries. In contrast, military personnel receive monthly pays of $100 for hardship duty and $225 for imminent danger. However, some special pays are unique to each group. For example, to partially reimburse those who are involuntarily separated from their dependents, military personnel are eligible to receive a family separation allowance that is not available to deployed DOD federal civilian personnel. Additionally, unlike DOD federal civilian personnel, military personnel also receive a combat zone tax exclusion while deployed to Afghanistan and Iraq that excludes certain income from federal taxes. DOD federal civilian personnel, by contrast, are eligible for a variety of premium pays, such as overtime and night differential, that are not available to military personnel. Although DOD federal civilian and military personnel generally receive various special pays to compensate them for conditions of deployment, in certain scenarios that we modeled, the overall amounts of compensation payments were higher for DOD federal civilian personnel than for military personnel, as illustrated in tables 6 and 7. In the event of sustaining an injury while deployed, DOD federal civilian and military personnel are eligible to receive two broad categories of disability benefits—disability compensation and disability retirement. However, the benefits applicable to each group vary by type and amount, depending on specific program provisions and individual circumstances. Within these broad categories, there are three main types of disability: (1) temporary disability, (2) permanent partial disability, and (3) permanent total disability. Both DOD federal civilian and military personnel who are injured in the line of duty are eligible to receive continuation of their pay during the initial period of treatment and may be eligible to receive recurring payments for lost wages. However, the payments to DOD federal civilian personnel are based on their salaries and whether the employee has any dependents, regardless of the number, which can vary significantly, whereas disability compensation payments made by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) to injured military personnel are based on the severity of the injury and their number of dependents. DOD federal civilian personnel are eligible to receive continuation of pay (salary) for up to 45 days, followed by a recurring payment for wage loss which is based on a percentage of salary and whether they have any dependents, up to a cap. In contrast, military personnel receive continuation of pay of their salary for generally no longer than a year, followed by a recurring VA disability compensation payment for wage loss that is based on the degree of disability and their number of dependents, and temporary DOD disability retirement for up to 5 years. Appendix II provides additional information on temporary disability compensation payments for federal civilian and military personnel. To illustrate the way in which the degree of impairment and an individual’s salary can affect temporary disability compensation, in our April 2006 review, we compared the disability benefits available to military personnel with those available to comparable civilian public safety officers at the federal, state, and local levels. We found that VA compensation payments for military personnel were based on a disability rating, regardless of salary level; in contrast, compensation payments for civilian public safety officers were based on salary level, regardless of disability level. Thus, for an individual with severe injuries and relatively low wages, VA compensation payments for military personnel were generally higher than those of the civilian public safety officers included in the reviews. However, if an individual had less severe injuries and high wages, VA compensation payments for military personnel were generally lower than those of the civilian public safety officers included in the review. When a partial disability is determined to be permanent, DOD federal civilian and military personnel can continue to receive recurring compensation payments. For DOD federal civilian personnel, these payments are provided for the remainder of life as long as the impairment persists, and can vary significantly depending upon the salary of the individual and the existence of dependents. Military personnel are also eligible to receive recurring VA disability compensation payments for the remainder of their lives, and these payments are based on the severity of the servicemember’s injury and the number of dependents. In addition, both groups are eligible to receive additional compensation payments beyond the recurring payments just discussed, based on the type of impairment. DOD federal civilians with permanent partial disabilities receive a schedule of payments based on the specific type of impairment (sometimes referred to as a schedule award). Some impairments may result in benefits for a few weeks, while others may result in benefits for several years. Similarly, military personnel receive special monthly VA compensation payments depending on the specific type and degree of impairment. Appendix II provides more detailed information on permanent partial disability compensation payments for DOD federal civilian and military personnel. Our April 2006 review compared the compensation benefits available to military personnel with those available to federal civilian public safety officers, among others, using several scenarios. Our analysis showed that when able to return to duty, military personnel often received a greater amount of compensation benefits over a lifetime than did civilians, even when the monthly benefit payment was substantially lower and receipt of benefits was delayed for several years. Permanent partial disabilities that prevent civilian and military personnel from returning to duty in their current jobs may entitle them to receive disability retirement benefits based on a percentage of salary in addition to compensation benefits; however, the eligibility criteria and benefit amounts differ. Under the Civil Service Retirement System (CSRS), DOD federal civilian personnel must be unfit for duty and have 5 years of service to qualify for disability retirement benefits. Under the Federal Employees’ Retirement System (FERS), civilian personnel must be unfit for duty and have 18 months of service. DOD federal civilian personnel must elect either compensation benefits or disability retirement. Military personnel who are unfit for duty are eligible for DOD disability retirement benefits if they have a disability rating of 30 percent or more regardless of length of service, or if they have 20 years or more of service regardless of disability rating. The amount of the DOD disability retirement payment is offset dollar for dollar, however, by the amount of the monthly VA disability compensation payment unless they have at least 20 years of service and a disability rating of 50 percent or more, or combat-related disabilities. Our April 2006 review of disability benefits showed that when military personnel and federal civilian public safety officers were unable to return to duty due to a permanent partial disability, such as a leg amputation, the combined compensation and retirement benefits provided to the military personnel over a lifetime were sometimes more, and sometimes less, than the combined benefits provided to civilian public safety officers. When an injury is severe enough to be deemed permanent and total, DOD federal civilian and military personnel may receive similar types of benefits such as disability compensation and retirement payments; however, the amounts paid to each group vary. For civilian personnel, the monthly payment amounts for total disability are generally similar to those for permanent partial disability described earlier, but unlike with permanent partial disabilities, the payments do not take into account any wage earning capacity. Both groups are eligible to receive additional compensation payments beyond the recurring payments that are similar to those for permanent partial disability. DOD federal civilians with permanent disabilities receive a schedule award based on the specific type of impairment. In addition, DOD federal civilian personnel may be eligible for an additional attendant allowance—up to $1,500 per month during 2006—if such care is needed. Military personnel receive special monthly VA compensation payments for particularly severe injuries, such as amputations, blindness, or other loss of use of organs and extremities. The payments are designed to account for attendant care or other special needs deriving from the disability. In addition to disability compensation, both DOD federal civilian and military personnel have access to disability retirement benefits for permanent total disabilities. The provisions for election and offset of disability compensation and disability retirement benefits in cases of permanent total disability are similar to provisions in cases of permanent partial disability discussed earlier. Another benefit available to DOD federal civilian and military personnel with permanent total disabilities is Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI). SSDI benefits are available to individuals who incur a physical or mental impairment that prevents them from performing substantial gainful activity and that is expected to last at least 1 year or to result in death. The benefit is based on the employee’s earnings history and lifetime contributions to Social Security; therefore, the benefit amounts vary widely among individuals. DOD federal civilian personnel covered by FERS and military personnel pay into Social Security and thus may be eligible to receive SSDI benefits. The maximum benefit to both groups in 2006 was $2,053 per month. However, DOD federal civilian personnel must choose between either compensation payments and SSDI benefits or have their disability retirement payments reduced when receiving SSDI benefits. Survivors of deceased DOD federal civilian and military personnel generally receive similar types of cash survivor benefits—either as a lump sum, a recurring payment, or both—through comparable sources. However, the benefit amounts generally differ for each group. Survivors of DOD federal civilian and military personnel also receive noncash benefits that differ in type and amounts. As shown in table 8, survivors of deceased DOD federal civilian and military personnel both receive lump sum benefits in the form of Social Security, a death gratuity, burial expenses, and life insurance. Social Security provides $255 upon the death of a DOD federal civilian employee or military member. In addition, survivors of deceased DOD federal civilian personnel receive a death gratuity of up to $10,000, while survivors of deceased military personnel receive $100,000. The payment for funeral expenses provided to survivors of deceased DOD federal civilian personnel can be as high as $800, plus $200 for costs associated with terminating employee status, while it can be $7,700 for deceased military personnel. Life insurance is another common source of benefits for the survivors of many deceased civilian and military personnel. Survivors of deceased federal civilian personnel receive a payment equal to the civilian’s rate of basic pay, rounded to the nearest thousand, plus $2,000. Military personnel automatically are insured as part of the Servicemembers’ Group Life Insurance for up to $400,000, unless they elect less or no coverage. DOD federal civilian employees also receive a survivor benefit in their retirement plans. Survivors of deceased DOD federal civilian and military personnel are also eligible for recurring benefits, some of which are specific to each group, as shown in table 9. Survivors of both deceased DOD federal civilian and military personnel may be eligible to receive recurring Social Security payments based on the deceased individual’s earnings in a covered period. However, other types of recurring payments are specific to either civilian or military personnel. For example, survivors of DOD federal civilian personnel may receive recurring payments from a retirement plan or workers’ compensation if the death occurred while in the line of duty. Survivors of deceased military personnel also receive payments through the Survivor Benefit Plan, Dependency and Indemnity Compensation, or both. In addition to lump sum and recurring benefits, survivors of deceased DOD federal civilians and military personnel receive noncash benefits. As shown in table 10, survivors of deceased military personnel receive more noncash benefits than do those of deceased DOD federal civilian personnel, with few benefits being comparable in type. For example, eligible survivors of military personnel who die while on active duty obtain benefits such as rent-free government housing or tax- free housing allowances for up to 365 days, relocation assistance, and lifetime access to commissaries and exchanges that are not available to civilian personnel who die in the line-of-duty. However, survivors of both deceased DOD federal civilian and military personnel do continue to receive health insurance that is wholly or partially subsidized. As DOD’s federal civilian employees assume an expanding role in helping the department support its contingency operations overseas, the need for attention to the policies and benefits that affect the health and welfare of these individuals becomes increasingly significant. DOD currently has important policies in place that relate to the deployment of its federal civilians. However, it lacks an adequate oversight and quality assurance mechanism to ensure compliance and quality of service. Thus, not all of its policies—such as those that define the department’s requirements for force health protection and surveillance—are being fully implemented by the DOD components. Until DOD improves its oversight in this area, it will jeopardize its ability to be effectively informed of the extent to which its federal civilians are screened and deemed medically fit to deploy in support of contingency operations; deployed civilian personnel receive needed immunizations to counter theater disease threats; and what medical follow-up attention federal civilians require for health problems or concerns that may arise following their deployment. To strengthen DOD’s force health protection and surveillance for its federal civilian personnel who deploy in support of contingency operations, we recommend that the Secretary of Defense direct the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Personnel and Readiness to establish an oversight and quality assurance mechanism to ensure that all components fully comply with its requirements. In written comments on a draft of this report, DOD partially concurred with our recommendation. The department acknowledged the necessity for all deployed civilians to receive required medical assessments and immunizations, and that documentation must be available in every instance. The department outlined several steps it intends to take to determine appropriate implementation of our recommendation. Specifically, the department stated that it has written and coordinated a new DOD instruction, scheduled to become effective before the end of 2006, that establishes a comprehensive DOD force health protection quality assurance program that will apply to DOD civilian personnel accompanying deploying military forces. While DOD’s response is encouraging, we remain concerned that the department’s description of the actions it plans to take to assess the components’ compliance with its requirements lacks sufficient detail. DOD was unable to provide us with a copy of the new instruction; thus, we could not evaluate the comprehensiveness of its new force health protection quality assurance program or determine whether the program identifies specific actions the department plans to take for assessing and ensuring the full implementation of the force health protection and surveillance requirements by all DOD components. DOD also stated that proposed revisions to its directives and instructions that address the planning, preparation, and utilization of DOD civilians include, among other things, annual assessments for compliance with pre-and post-deployment medical assessment requirements. However, the department did not describe what actions, if any, it plans to take to ensure that it will be sufficiently informed of the extent to which its components are complying with existing health protection requirements for its deployed federal civilians. In the absence of more specific details on its planned actions, we continue to emphasize the department’s need for a comprehensive oversight and quality assurance mechanism without which it will not be effectively positioned to ensure compliance with its policies, or ensure the health care and protection of its deployed federal civilians as they continue to support contingency operations. In addition to its comments on our recommendation, the department took issue with some of our specific findings. DOD questioned our findings that in many cases DOD components were unable to produce documentation confirming that deployed federal civilians had received necessary pre- or post-deployment medical assessments, or immunizations. The department stated that DOD activities, particularly regarding the Army Corps of Engineers, Transatlantic Programs Center (TPC), had determined that documentation did exist for many records included in our review, thus raising reservations about our findings. In particular, the department stated that the number (and percent) of records missing two or more immunizations that we reported for TPC was inaccurate. It stated that based on TPC’s review of the specific documentation that we used to support our findings, we had actually identified 69 records (54.3 percent) as missing two or more immunizations, rather than 85 (66.9 percent) noted in our draft report. We disagree. TPC overlooked 16 records included in our review that lacked documentation of any immunizations. Moreover, as we noted in our report, to provide assurances that the results of our review of hard copy deployment records at the selected component locations were accurate, we requested that each component’s designated medical personnel reexamine those deployment records that we determined were missing required health documentation. We then adjusted our results in those instances where documentation was subsequently provided. To provide additional assurances regarding our determinations, we requested that each component’s designated medical personnel review and sign the data collection instrument that we used to collect deployment health information from each individual civilian’s deployment record attesting to our conclusions regarding the existence of health assessment or immunization documentation. DOD also stated that we inappropriately mixed discussion of Veterans Affairs and DOD benefits without distinguishing between the two. However, our report appropriately discusses two broad categories of “government-provided” benefits: (1) those provided by DOD and (2) those provided by VA. Nonetheless, to further clarify this section of our report, we added “VA” and “DOD” to our discussions of disability compensation and retirement benefits for military personnel. DOD also stated that our discussion of military disability benefits presented incorrect information in many cases, indicating that our statements that compensation payments for military personnel were based on a disability rating, regardless of salary level is only true with regard to VA disability benefits. DOD also stated that DOD disability payments do, in fact, take into account salary level, and that if a former member is entitled to both, there is an offsetting mechanism. We agree. As we state in our report, under veterans’ compensation programs, benefits typically include cash payments to replace a percentage of the individual’s loss in wages while injured and unable to work. We also state that disability retirement benefits for military personnel are based on a percent of salary in addition to compensation benefits, and that the amount of retirement payment is offset dollar for dollar by the amount of monthly compensation payment unless military personnel have at least 20 years of service and a disability rating of 50 percent or more, or have combat-related disabilities. Further, DOD submitted detailed comments related to our analysis of special pays and benefits provided to deployed DOD federal civilian and military personnel. In particular, the department stated that our selection and presentation of the associated data on the special pays and benefits provided to DOD federal civilian and military personnel could easily mislead the reader into drawing erroneous conclusions. The department also stated that our comparisons did not take into account the relative value of certain key benefits for which explicit dollar amounts cannot be measured, such as retirement systems, health care systems, and military commissary exchange privileges. To the contrary, our report did discuss this limitation, and as is the case with any modeled scenarios based on certain assumptions, some of the factors with the potential to affect the overall outcomes of our comparisons could not be included because of, as DOD pointed out, the relative value of certain key benefits for which explicit dollar amounts cannot be measured. It is partly for this reason that we acknowledged in the report that we do not take a position on the adequacy or appropriateness of the special pays and benefits provided to DOD federal civilian and military personnel. DOD also requested that we clearly acknowledge the fundamental differences between the military and civilians systems. We believe that we have done so. As we noted in our report, we did not make direct analytical comparisons between compensation and benefits offered by DOD to deployed federal civilian and military personnel because such comparisons must account for the demands of the military service, such as involuntary relocation, frequent and lengthy separations from family, and liability for combat. DOD provided other technical comments, which we have incorporated as appropriate. The department’s comments are reprinted in their entirety in appendix III. We are sending copies of this report to the Chairman and Ranking Minority Member, Senate Committee on Armed Services; the Chairman and Ranking Minority Member, House Committee on Armed Services; the Chairman and Ranking Minority Member, Subcommittee on Defense, Senate Committee on Appropriations; and the Chairman and Ranking Minority Member, Subcommittee on Defense, House Committee on Appropriations; and other interested congressional parties. We are also sending copies to the Secretary of Defense and the Under Secretary of Defense for Personnel and Readiness. We will make copies available to other interested parties upon request. Copies of this report will also be made available at no charge on GAO’s Web site at http://www.gao.gov.

To assess the extent to which DOD has established force health protection and surveillance policies for DOD federal civilians who deploy outside of the United States in support of contingency operations, and how the components (military services and the Defense Contract Management Agency) have implemented those policies, we reviewed pertinent force health protection and surveillance policies and discussed these policies with the following offices or commands: U.S. Central Command; Joint Chiefs of Staff, Manpower and Personnel; Under Secretary of Defense for Personnel and Readiness (including the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Health Affairs, Deployment Health Support Directorate; Civilian Personnel Policy; and Civilian Personnel Management Services); the Surgeons General for the Army, Navy, and Air Force; and the Defense Contract Management Agency (DCMA). Our review focused on DOD federal civilians who (1) deployed to Afghanistan or Iraq for 30 continuous days or more between June 1, 2003, and September 30, 2005, and (2) returned to the United States by February 28, 2006. Because DOD had difficulty identifying the total number of federal civilians who deployed to Afghanistan or Iraq, we assessed the implementation of DOD’s deployment health requirements at eight component locations that were selected using a number of approaches. Given that DOD components have flexibility in where they conduct deployment processing, we selected locations for our review accordingly. Specifically, the Army uses a centralized approach, deploying its federal civilians at three primary locations; therefore, we selected all three locations for review. By contrast, the Navy and Air Force use a decentralized approach, deploying their federal civilians from their home stations. For these components, we selected five locations based on data that indicated that these locations had deployed the largest numbers of federal civilian personnel. DCMA was included in our review because it had deployed the largest number of federal civilian personnel compared to other defense agencies. DCMA has an informal agreement with the Army to process its federal civilians through two of the Army’s three deployment locations. Therefore, DCMA federal civilian deployment data in this report are included in the Army results to the extent that DCMA federal civilian deployments were documented at the two relevant Army locations. At all eight component locations, we reviewed either all available hard copy or electronic deployment records, or in one instance, a sample of the deployment records for deployed federal civilian personnel who met our criteria above. Table 11 shows the locations included in our review and the number of deployment records reviewed at each location. In total, we reviewed 3,431 hard copy and automated records for federal civilian personnel who deployed to Afghanistan and Iraq. Specifically, we reviewed hard copies of deployment records for 454 (out of a reported 822) federal civilian personnel at seven component locations and automated deployment records for 2,977 (out of the reported 2,977) federal civilian personnel at the other location where all deployment records were being maintained electronically. The results of deployment record reviews, however, could not be projected beyond the samples to all DOD federal civilians who had deployed during this time frame. To facilitate our review of federal civilian deployment records at the selected component locations, we developed a data collection instrument to review and collect deployment health information from each individual civilian’s deployment record. For federal civilians in our review at each location, we reviewed deployment records for documentation that the following force health protection and surveillance policy requirements were met: Pre-and post-deployment health assessments; Tuberculosis screening test (within 1 year of deployment); Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) screening test; Pre-deployment immunizations: hepatitis A (first and second course); influenza (within 1 year of deployment); tetanus-diphtheria (within 10 years of deployment); typhoid; and smallpox (within 5 years of deployment) After our review of hard copy deployment records, we requested each component’s medical personnel to reexamine those hard copy deployment records that were missing required health documentation, and we adjusted our results where documentation was subsequently provided. We also requested and queried other documentation from information systems used by the components to capture deployment and related health information, making adjustments to our results where documentation was found in the systems. These data sources included the Army’s Medical Protection System (MEDPROS), the Army’s medical database (MedBase), the Air Force’s Preventive Health Assessment and Individual Medical Readiness (PIMR) system and its Comprehensive Immunization Tracking Application (CITA), DOD’s Defense Enrollment Eligibility Reporting System (DEERS), which is used by the Navy, and the Army Medical Surveillance Activity’s Defense Medical Surveillance System (DMSS). At the Army’s Fort Benning, we created a sampling frame (i.e., total population) of records for 606 federal civilian deployments between June 1, 2003, and September 30, 2005. Our study population was limited to DOD federal civilians who deployed to Afghanistan or Iraq. We then drew a stratified random sample of 288 deployment records and stratified the sample to isolate potential duplicate deployment records for the same federal civilian. We found two duplicate records and removed them from both the population and sample, as shown in table 12. We also removed another 14 deployment records from our sample because those DOD federal civilians had been deployed to locations other than Afghanistan or Iraq, and were not eligible for the duty population. In addition, we removed another 13 deployment records that were originally selected as potential replacement records; however, we found that those replacements were not needed. Ultimately, we identified 238 in-scope responses, for a weighted response rate of 87 percent. Each sampled record was subsequently weighted in the analysis to represent all DOD federal civilians deployed to Afghanistan or Iraq. The disposition of the federal civilian deployment records we reviewed at Fort Benning are summarized in the following table: Our probability sample is only one of a large number of samples that we might have drawn. Because each sample could have provided different estimates, we express our confidence in the precision of our particular sample’s results as a 95 percent confidence interval. This is the interval that would contain the actual population value for 95 percent of the Fort Benning, Ga., samples we could have drawn. All percentage estimates from our sample have margins of error (that is, widths of confidence intervals) of plus or minus 5 percentage points or less, at the 95 percent confidence level, unless otherwise noted. We took steps to assess the reliability of DOD federal civilian deployment and health data for the purposes of this review, including consideration of issues such as the completeness of the data from the respective information systems’ program managers and administrators. We also examined whether the data were subjected to quality control measures such as periodic testing of the data against deployment records to ensure the accuracy and reliability of the data. In addition, we reviewed existing documentation related to the data sources and interviewed knowledgeable agency officials about the data. We did not find these deployment and health data to be sufficiently reliable for (1) identifying the universe of DOD federal civilian deployments or (2) use as the sole source for reviewing the health and immunization information for all DOD federal civilian deployments, but we found the information systems to be sufficiently reliable when used as one of several sources in our review of deployment records. In those instances where we did not find a deployment health assessment or immunization in either the deployment records or in the electronic data systems, we concluded that the health assessment or immunization was not documented. To determine the extent to which DOD has established and the components have implemented medical treatment policies for DOD federal civilians who deployed in support of contingency operations, we examined pertinent medical treatment policies for DOD federal civilian employees who required treatment for injuries and diseases sustained while supporting contingency operations. In addition, we obtained workers’ compensation claims filed by DOD federal civilian personnel with the Department of Labor’s Office of Workers’ Compensation Programs(OWCP) showing those civilians who sustained injuries and diseases during deployment. We selected and reviewed a non-probability sample of claims to assess the components’ processes and procedures for implementing DOD’s medical treatment policies across a range of civilian casualties including injuries, physical and mental illnesses, and diseases. The scope of our review did not extend to the Department of Labor’s claims review process. To identify special pays and benefits provided to DOD federal civilians who deployed in support of contingency operations and to assess the extent that special pays and benefits differ from those provided to deployed active duty military personnel, we examined major statutory provisions for special pays, disability and death benefits for federal civilians and military personnel, including relevant chapters of Title 5 of the U.S. Code governing federal civilian personnel management; relevant chapters of Title 10 of the U.S. Code governing armed forces personnel management; Section 112 of Title 26 of the U.S. Code governing combat zone tax exemption; relevant chapters of Title 37 of the U.S. Code governing pay and allowances for the uniformed services; relevant chapters of Title 38 of the U.S. Code governing veterans’ benefits; relevant provisions of applicable public laws governing military and civilian pay and benefits; applicable directives and instructions related to active duty military and DOD federal civilian benefits and entitlements; DOD financial management regulations; Department of State regulations; and prior GAO reports. In addition, we discussed the statutes and guidance with cognizant officials of the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Personnel and Readiness, military services’ headquarters, and the Defense Contract Management Agency involved with the administration of active duty and federal civilian personnel entitlements. We did not perform a comprehensive review of all compensation—comprised of a myriad of pays and benefits—offered to active duty military and federal civilian personnel in general. Our analysis focused on selected elements of compensation such as special pays (e.g., hostile fire/imminent danger pay). Also, we did not make direct analytical comparisons between compensation and benefits offered by DOD to deployed federal civilian and military personnel because such comparisons must account for the demands of the military service, such as involuntary relocation, frequent and lengthy separations from family, and liability for combat. After reviewing documents and interviewing officials, we then compiled and analyzed the information on the types and amounts of special pays and benefits available to active duty military and DOD federal civilian personnel who deployed to Afghanistan or Iraq. We interviewed DOD officials to discuss the basis for any differences in compensation. In addition, to illustrate how special pays affect overall compensation provided to DOD federal civilian and military personnel, we modeled scenarios for both groups using similar circumstances, such as length of deployment, pay grades, special pays (e.g., post differential pay, danger pay, overtime pay, family separation allowance, basic allowance for housing, basic allowance for subsistence), and duty location. Through discussions with senior DOD officials, we made an assumption that deployed DOD federal civilians worked 30 hours of overtime per week. For deployed DOD federal civilians, we subtracted a contribution of $15,000 to the Thrift Savings Plan (TSP) to obtain the adjusted gross income. We assumed that DOD federal civilians, temporarily at a higher tax bracket, would take maximum advantage of the opportunity to defer taxes. We assumed that the military personnel would contribute a smaller percentage of pay, 5 percent of gross income, to TSP. We made this assumption because much of the military pay was not subject to federal taxes, which removes the incentive to contribute to TSP, and because unlike for federal workers, military TSP does not have a matching component. For military personnel, we also deducted the amount of pay not subject to taxes due to the combat zone exclusion, family separation allowance, basic allowance for subsistence, and basic allowance for housing. Using these assumptions, we generated an adjusted gross income and used that as input into a commercial tax program, Turbo Tax, to obtain federal taxes owed. We assumed that both DOD federal civilian and military personnel were married, filing jointly, with a spouse that earned no income. We assumed that the family had two children and qualified for two child tax credits, and the Earned Income Tax Credit, if at that income level. This resulted in four exemptions and a standard deduction of $10,000 in 2005. For purposes of validation, we repeated this exercise using an alternate tax program, Tax Cut, and obtained identical results. We conducted our review from March 2006 to August 2006 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards. Both DOD federal civilian and military personnel are eligible to receive disability benefits when they sustain a line-of-duty injury. However, these benefits vary in amount. Table 13 shows the temporary disability benefits available to eligible DOD federal civilian and military personnel. As table 13 shows, DOD federal civilians who are injured in the line of duty are eligible to receive continuation of their salary up to 45 days, followed by a recurring payment for wage loss that is based on a percentage of their salary and the existence of dependents, up to a cap. In contrast, military personnel receive continuation of their salaries for generally no longer than a year, followed by a recurring payment for wage loss, which is based on the degree of disability and their number of dependents, and temporary retirement pay based on salary for up to 5 years. When a partial disability is determined to be permanent, both DOD federal civilians and military personnel are eligible to continue receiving recurring compensation payments, but again, the amounts of these benefits vary, as shown in table 14. As table 14 shows, DOD federal civilian personnel with permanent partial disabilities receive payments based on salary and dependents while military personnel receive payments based on the severity of the injury and their number of dependents, as long as the condition persists. In addition to the contact named above, Sandra Burrell, Assistant Director; William Bates; Dr. Benjamin Bolitzer; Alissa Czyz; George Duncan; Steve Fox; Dawn Godfrey; Nancy Hess; Lynn Johnson; Barbara Joyce; Dr. Ronald La Due Lake; William Mathers; Paul Newton; Dr. Charles Perdue; Jason Porter; Julia Matta; Susan Tieh; John Townes; and Dr. Monica Wolford made key contributions to this report.', 'summary': \"As the Department of Defense (DOD) has expanded its involvement in overseas military operations, it has grown increasingly reliant on its federal civilian workforce to support contingency operations. The Senate Armed Services Committee required GAO to examine DOD's policies concerning the health care for DOD civilians who deploy in support of contingency operations in Afghanistan and Iraq. GAO analyzed over 3,400 deployment-related records for deployed federal civilians and interviewed department officials to determine the extent to which DOD has established and the military services and defense agencies (hereafter referred to as DOD components) have implemented (1) force health protection and surveillance policies and (2) medical treatment policies and procedures for its deployed federal civilians. GAO also examined the differences in special pays and benefits provided to DOD's deployed federal civilians and military personnel. DOD has established force health protection and surveillance policies to assess and reduce or prevent health risks for its deployed federal civilian personnel, but it lacks procedures to ensure implementation. Our review of over 3,400 deployment records at eight component locations found that components lacked documentation that some federal civilian personnel who deployed to Afghanistan and Iraq had received, among other things, required pre- and post-deployment health assessments and immunizations. These deficiencies were most prevalent at Air Force and Navy locations, and one Army location. As a larger issue, DOD lacked complete and centralized data to readily identify its deployed federal civilians and their movement in theater, further hindering its efforts to assess the overall effectiveness of its force health protection and surveillance capabilities. In August 2006, DOD issued a revised policy which outlined procedures that are intended to address these shortcomings. However, these procedures are not comprehensive enough to ensure that DOD will know the extent to which its components are complying with existing health protection requirements. In particular, the procedures do not establish an oversight and quality assurance mechanism for assessing the implementation of its force health protection and surveillance requirements. Until DOD establishes a mechanism to strengthen its force health protection and surveillance oversight, it will not be effectively positioned to ensure compliance with its policies, or the health care and protection of deployed federal civilians. DOD has also established medical treatment policies for its deployed federal civilians which provide those who require treatment for injuries or diseases sustained during overseas hostilities with care that is equivalent in scope to that provided to active duty military personnel under the DOD military health system. GAO reviewed a sample of seven workers' compensation claims (out of a universe of 83) filed under the Federal Employees' Compensation Act by DOD federal civilians who deployed to Iraq. GAO found in three cases where care was initiated in theater, that the affected civilians had received treatment in accordance with DOD's policies. In all seven cases, DOD federal civilians who requested care after returning to the United States had, in accordance with DOD's policies, received medical examinations and/or treatment for their deployment-related injuries or diseases through either military or civilian treatment facilities. DOD provides certain special pays and benefits to its deployed federal civilians, which generally differ in type and/or amount from those provided to deployed military personnel. For example, both civilian and military personnel are eligible to receive disability benefits for deployment-related injuries; however, the type and amount of these benefits vary, and some are unique to each group. Further, while the survivors of deceased federal civilian and military personnel generally receive similar types of cash survivor benefits, the comparative amounts of these benefits differ.\"}\n",
      "{'document': 'Most income derived from private sector business activity in the United States is subject to federal corporate income tax, the individual income tax, or both. The tax treatment that applies to a business depends on its legal form of organization. Firms that are organized under the tax code as “C” corporations (which include most large, publicly held corporations) have their profits taxed once at the entity level under the corporate income tax (on a form 1120) and then a second time under the individual income tax when profits are transferred to individual shareholders in the form of dividends or realized capital gains. Firms that are organized as “pass-through” entities, such as partnerships, limited liability companies, and “S” corporations are generally not taxed at the entity level; however, their net incomes are passed through each year and taxed in the hands of their partners or shareholders under the individual income tax (as part of those taxpayers’ form 1040 filing). Similarly, income from businesses that are owned by single individuals enters into the taxable incomes of those owners under the individual income tax and is not subject to a separate entity-level tax. The base of the federal corporate income tax includes net income from business operations (receipts, minus the costs of purchased goods, labor, interest, and other expenses). It also includes net income that corporations earn in the form of interest, dividends, rent, royalties, and realized capital gains. The statutory rate of tax on net corporate income ranges from 15 to 35 percent, depending on the amount of income earned. The United States taxes the worldwide income of domestic corporations, regardless of where the income is earned, with a foreign tax credit for certain taxes paid to other countries. However, the timing of the tax liability depends on several factors, including whether the income is from a U.S. or foreign source and, if it is from a foreign source, whether it is earned through direct operations or through a subsidiary. The base of the individual income tax covers business-source income paid to individuals, such as dividends, realized net capital gains on corporate equity, and income from self-employment. The statutory rates of tax on net taxable income range from 10 percent to 35 percent. Lower rates (generally 5 percent and 15 percent, depending on taxable income) apply to long-term capital gains and dividend income. Sole proprietors also pay both the employer and employee shares of social insurance taxes on their net business income. Generally, a U.S. citizen or resident pays tax on his or her worldwide income, including income derived from foreign-source dividends and capital gains subject to a credit for foreign taxes paid on such income. Three long-standing criteria—economic efficiency, equity, and a combination of simplicity, transparency and administrability—are typically used to evaluate tax policy. These criteria are often in conflict with each other, and as a result, there are usually trade-offs to consider and people are likely to disagree about the relative importance of the criteria. Specific aspects of business taxes can be evaluated in terms of how they support or detract from the efficiency, equity, simplicity, transparency, and administrability of the overall tax system. To the extent that a tax system is not simple and efficient, it imposes costs on taxpayers beyond the payments they make to the U.S. Treasury. As shown in figure 1, the total cost of any tax from a taxpayer’s point of view is the sum of the tax liability, the cost of complying with the tax system, and the economic efficiency costs that the tax imposes. In deciding on the size of government, we balance the total cost of taxes with the benefits provided by government programs. A complete evaluation of the tax treatment of businesses, which is a critical element of our overall federal tax system, cannot be made without considering how business taxation interacts with and complements the other elements of the overall system, such as the tax treatment of individuals and excise taxes on selected goods and services. This integrated approach is also appropriate for evaluating reform alternatives, regardless of whether those alternatives take the form of a simplified income tax system, a consumption tax system, or some combination of the two. Businesses contribute significant revenues to the federal government, both directly and indirectly. As figure 2 shows, corporate businesses paid $278 billion in corporate income tax directly to the federal government in 2005. Individuals earn income from business investment in the form of dividends and realized capital gains from C corporations; income allocations from partnerships and S corporations; entrepreneurial income from their own sole proprietorships; and rents and royalties. In recent years this business- source income, which is all taxed under the individual income tax, has amounted to between roughly 14 percent and 19 percent of the income of individuals who have paid individual income tax. In addition to the taxes that are paid on business-source income, most of the remainder of federal taxes is collected and passed on to the government by businesses. Business tax revenues of the magnitude discussed make them very relevant to considerations about how to address the nation’s long-term fiscal imbalance. Over the long term, the United States faces a large and growing structural budget deficit primarily caused by demographic trends and rising health care costs as shown in figure 3, and exacerbated over time by growing interest on the ever-larger federal debt. Continuing on this imprudent and unsustainable fiscal path will gradually erode, if not suddenly damage, our economy, our standard of living, and ultimately our national security. We cannot grow our way out of this long-term fiscal challenge because the imbalance between spending and revenue is so large. We will need to make tough choices using a multipronged approach: (1) revise budget processes and financial reporting requirements; (2) restructure entitlement programs; (3) reexamine the base of discretionary spending and other spending; and (4) review and revise tax policy, including tax expenditures, and tax enforcement programs. Business tax policy, business tax expenditures, and business tax enforcement need to be part of the overall tax review because of the amount of revenue at stake. Business tax expenditures reduce the revenue that would otherwise be raised from businesses. As already noted, to reduce their tax liabilities, businesses can take advantage of preferential provisions in the tax code, such as exclusions, exemptions, deductions, credits, preferential rates, and deferral of tax liability. Tax preferences—which are legally known as tax expenditures—are often aimed at policy goals similar to those of federal spending programs. For example, there are different tax expenditures intended to encourage economic development in disadvantaged areas and stimulate research and development, while there are also federal spending programs that have similar purposes. Also, by narrowing the tax base, business tax expenditures have the effect of raising either business tax rates or the rates on other taxpayers in order to generate a given amount of revenue. The design of the current system of business taxation causes economic inefficiency and is complex. The complexity provides fertile ground for noncompliance and raises equity concerns. Our current system for taxing business income causes economic inefficiency because it imposes significantly different effective rates of tax on different types of investments. Tax treatment that is not neutral across different types of capital investment causes significant economic inefficiency by guiding investments to lightly taxed activities rather than those with high pretax productivity. However, the goal of tax policy is not to eliminate efficiency costs. The goal is to design a tax system that produces a desired amount of revenue and balances economic efficiency with other objectives, such as equity, simplicity, transparency, and administrability. Every practical tax system imposes efficiency costs. There are some features of current business taxation that have attracted criticism by economists and other tax experts because of efficiency costs. My point in raising them here is not that these features need to be changed—that is a policy judgment for Congress to make as it balances various goals. Rather, my point is that these economic consequences of tax policy need to be considered as we think about reform. The following are among the most noted cases of nonneutral taxation in the federal business tax system: Income earned on equity-financed investments made by C corporations is taxed twice—under both the corporate and individual income taxes, whereas no other business income is taxed more than once. Moreover, even noncorporate business investment is taxed more heavily than owner-occupied housing—a form of capital investment that receives very preferential treatment. As a result, resources have been shifted away from higher-return business investment into owner-occupied housing, and, within the business sector, resources have been shifted from higher-return corporations to noncorporate businesses. Such shifting of investment makes workers less productive than they would be under a more neutral tax system. This results in employees receiving lower wages because increases in employee wages are generally tied to increases in productivity. As noted above, such efficiency costs may be worth paying in order to meet other policy goals. For example, many policymakers advocate increased homeownership as a social policy goal. Depreciation allowances under the tax code vary considerably in generosity across different assets causing effective tax rates to vary and, thereby, favoring investment in certain assets over others. For example, researchers have found that the returns on most types of investments in equipment are taxed more favorably than are most investments in nonresidential buildings. These biases shift resources away from some investments in buildings that would have been more productive than some of the equipment investments that are being made instead. Tax rules for corporations favor the use of debt over shareholder equity as a source of finance for investment. The return on debt- financed investment consists of interest payments to the corporation’s creditors, which are deductible by the corporations. Consequently, that return is taxed only once—in the hands of the creditors. In contrast, the return on equity-financed investment consists of dividends and capital gains, which are not deductible by the corporation. These forms of income that are taxed under the individual tax are paid out of income that has already been subject to the corporate income tax. The bias against equity finance induces corporations to have less of an “equity cushion” against business downturns. Capital gains on corporate equity are taxed more favorably than dividends because that tax can be deferred until the gains are realized (typically when shareholders sell their stock). This bias against dividend payments likely means that more profits are retained within corporations than otherwise would be the case and, therefore, the flow of capital to its most productive uses is being constrained. The complex set of rules governing U.S. taxation of the worldwide income of domestic corporations (those incorporated in the United States) leads to wide variations in the effective rate of tax paid on that income, based on the nature and location of each corporation’s foreign operations and the effort put into tax planning. In effect, the active foreign income of some U.S. corporations is taxed more heavily than if the United States followed the practice of many other countries and exempted such income from tax. However, other U.S. corporations are able to take advantage of flexibilities in the U.S. tax rules in order to achieve treatment that is equivalent to or, in some cases, more favorable than the so-called “territorial” tax systems that exempt foreign-source active business income. As a consequence, some U.S. corporations face a tax disadvantage, while others have an advantage, relative to foreign corporations when competing in foreign countries. Those U.S. corporations that have a disadvantage are likely to locate a smaller share of their investment overseas than would be the case in a tax-free world; the opposite is true for those U.S. corporations with the tax advantage. Moreover, the tax system encourages U.S. corporations to alter their cash-management and financing decisions (such as by delaying the repatriation of profits) in order to reduce their taxes. The taxation of business income is part of the broader taxation of income from capital. The taxation of capital income in general (even when that taxation is uniformly applied) causes another form of inefficiency beyond the inefficiencies caused by the aforementioned cases of differential taxation across types of investments. This additional inefficiency occurs because taxes on capital reduce the after-tax return on savings and, thereby, distort the choice that individuals make between current consumption and saving for future consumption. However, although research shows that the demand for some types of savings, such as the demand for tax exempt bonds, is responsive to tax changes, there is greater uncertainty about the effects of tax changes on other choices, such as aggregate savings. Sometimes the concerns about the negative effects of taxation on the U.S. economy are couched in terms of “competitiveness,” where the vaguely defined term competitiveness is often defined as the ability of U.S. businesses to export their products to foreign markets and to compete against foreign imports into the U.S. market. The goal of those who push for this type of competitiveness is to improve the U.S. balance of trade. However, economists generally agree that trying to increase the U.S. balance of trade through targeted tax breaks for exports does not work. Such a policy, aimed at lowering the prices of exports, would be offset by an increase in the value of the dollar which would make U.S. exports more expensive and imports into the Unites States less expensive, ultimately leaving both the balance of trade and the standard of living of Americans unchanged. An alternative definition of competitiveness that is also sometimes used in tax policy debates refers to the ability of U.S.-owned firms operating abroad to compete in foreign markets. The current U.S. policy of taxing the worldwide income of U.S. businesses places some of their foreign operations at a disadvantage. The tradeoffs between a worldwide system and a territorial tax system are discussed below. Tax compliance requirements for businesses are extensive and complex. Rules governing the computation of taxable income, expense deductions, and tax credits of U.S. corporations that do business in multiple foreign countries are particularly complex. But even small businesses face multiple levels of tax requirements of varying difficulty. In addition to computing and documenting their income, expenses, and qualifications for various tax credits, businesses with employees are responsible for collecting and remitting (at varying intervals) several federal taxes on the incomes of those employees. Moreover, if the businesses choose to offer their employees retirement plans and other fringe benefits, they can substantially increase the number of filings they must make. Businesses also have information-reporting responsibilities—employers send wage statements to their employees and to IRS; banks and other financial intermediaries send investment income statements to clients and to IRS. Finally, a relatively small percentage of all businesses (which nevertheless number in the hundreds of thousands) are required to participate in the collection of various federal excise taxes levied on fuels, heavy trucks and trailers, communications, guns, tobacco, and alcohol, among other products. It is difficult for researchers to accurately estimate compliance costs for the tax system as a whole or for particular types of taxpayers because taxpayers generally do not keep records of the time and money spent complying with tax requirements. Studies we found that focus on the compliance costs of businesses estimate them to be between about $40 billion and $85 billion per year. None of these estimates include the costs to businesses of collecting and remitting income and payroll taxes for their employees. The accuracy of these business compliance cost estimates is uncertain due to the low rates of response to their data-collection surveys. In addition, the range in estimates across the studies is due, among other things, to differences in monetary values used (ranging between $25 per hour and $37.26 per hour), differences in the business populations covered, and differences in the tax years covered. Although the precise amount of business tax avoidance is unknown, IRS’s latest estimates of tax compliance show a tax gap of at least $141 billion for tax year 2001 between the business taxes that individual and corporate taxpayers paid and what they should have paid under the law. Corporations contributed about $32 billion to the tax gap by underreporting about $30 billion in taxes on tax returns and failing to pay about $2 billion in taxes that were reported on returns. Individual taxpayers that underreported their business income accounted for the remaining $109 billion of the business income tax gap. A complex tax code, complicated business transactions, and often multinational corporate structures make determining business tax liabilities and the extent of corporate tax avoidance a challenge. Tax avoidance has become such a concern that some tax experts say corporate tax departments have become “profit centers” as corporations seek to take advantage of the tax laws in order to maximize shareholder value. Some corporate tax avoidance is clearly legal, some falls in gray areas of the tax code, and some is clearly noncompliance or illegal, as shown by IRS’s tax gap estimate. Often business tax avoidance is legal. For example, multinational corporations can locate active trade or business operations in jurisdictions that have lower effective tax rates than does the United States and, unless and until they repatriate the income, defer taxation in the United States on that income, thus reducing their effective tax rate. In addition, investors can avoid paying the corporate income tax by putting their money into unincorporated businesses or into real estate. Complicating corporate tax compliance is the fact that in many cases the law is unclear or subject to differing interpretations. In fact, some have postulated that major corporations’ tax returns are actually just the opening bid in an extended negotiation with IRS to determine a corporation’s tax liability. An illustration—once again from the complex area of international tax rules—is transfer pricing. Transfer pricing involves setting the appropriate price for such things as goods, services, or intangible property (such as patents, trademarks, copyrights, technology, or “know-how”) that is transferred between the U.S.-based operations of a multinational company and a foreign affiliate. If the price paid by the affiliate to the U.S. operation is understated, the profits of the U.S. operation are reduced and U.S. taxable income is inappropriately reduced or eliminated. The standard for judging the correct price is the price that would have been paid between independent enterprises acting at “arm’s length.” However, it can be extremely difficult to establish what an arm’s length price would be. Given the global economy and the number of multinational firms with some U.S.-based operations, opportunities for transfer pricing disputes are likely to grow. Tax shelters are one example of how tax avoidance, including corporate tax avoidance, can shade into the illegal. Some tax shelters are legal though perhaps aggressive interpretations of the law, but others cross the line. Abusive shelters often are complex transactions that manipulate many parts of the tax code or regulations and are typically buried among legitimate transactions reported on tax returns. Because these transactions are often composed of many pieces located in several parts of a complex tax return, they are essentially hidden from plain sight, which contributes to the difficulty of determining the scope of the abusive shelter problem. Often lacking economic substance or a business purpose other than generating tax benefits, abusive shelters have been promoted by some tax professionals, often in confidence, for significant fees, sometimes with the participation of tax-indifferent parties, such as foreign or tax-exempt entities. These shelters may involve unnecessary steps and flow-through entities, such as partnerships, which make detection of these transactions more difficult. Regarding compliance with our tax laws, the success of our tax system hinges greatly on individual and business taxpayers’ perception of its fairness and understandability. Compliance is influenced not only by the effectiveness of IRS’s enforcement efforts but also by Americans’ attitudes about the tax system and their government. A recent survey indicated that about 10 percent of respondents say it is acceptable to cheat on their taxes. Furthermore, the complexity of, and frequent revisions to, the tax system make it more difficult and costly for taxpayers who want to comply to do so and for IRS to explain and enforce tax laws. The lack of transparency also fuels disrespect for the tax system and the government. Thus, a crucial challenge in evaluating our business tax system will be to determine how we can best strengthen enforcement of existing laws to give businesses owners confidence that their competitors are paying their fair share and to give wage earners confidence that businesses in general bear their share of taxes. One option that has been suggested as a means of improving public confidence in the tax system’s fairness is to make the reconciliation between book and tax income that businesses present on schedule M-3 of their tax returns available for public review. Reform of our business tax system will necessarily mean making broad design choices about the overall tax system and how business taxes are coordinated with other taxes. The tax reform debate of the last several years has focused attention on several important choices, including the extent to which our system should be closer to the extreme of a pure income tax or the other extreme of a pure consumption tax, the extent to which sales by U.S. businesses outside of this country should be taxed, the extent to which taxes should be collected from businesses or individuals, and the extent to which taxpayers are compensated for losses or costs they incur during the transition to any new tax system. Generally there is no single “right” decision about these choices and the options are not limited to selecting a system that is at one extreme or the other along the continuum of potential systems. The choices will involve making tradeoffs between the various goals for our tax system. The fundamental difference between income and consumption taxes lies in their treatment of savings and investment. Income can be used for either consumption or saving and investment. The tax base of a pure income tax includes all income, regardless of what it is ultimately used for; in contrast, the tax base of a consumption tax excludes income devoted to saving and investment (until it is ultimately used for consumption). The current tax system is a hybrid between a pure income tax and a pure consumption tax because it effectively exempts some types of savings and investment but taxes other types. As noted earlier, evidence is inconclusive regarding whether a shift closer to a consumption tax base would significantly affect the level of savings by U.S. taxpayers. There is, however, a consensus among economists that uneven tax treatment across different types of investment should be avoided unless the efficiency costs resulting from preferential tax treatment are outweighed by the social benefits generated by the tax preference. That objective could be achieved under either a consumption tax that exempts all new savings and investment from taxation (which means that all business profits are exempt) or a revised income tax that taxed all investments at the same effective rate. In comparison to the current system, a consumption tax’s exemption of business-source income would likely encourage U.S. businesses to increase their investment in the United States relative to their foreign investment. Both income and consumption taxes can be structured in a variety of ways, as discussed in the following subsections, and the choice of a specific design for either type of tax can have as significant implications for efficiency, administrability, and equity as the choice between a consumption or income base. The exemption of saving and investment can be accomplished in different ways, so consumption taxes can be structured differently and yet still have the same overall tax base. Both income and consumption taxes can be levied on individuals or businesses, or on a combination of the two. Whether collected from individuals or businesses, ultimately, individuals will bear the economic burden of any tax (as wage earners, shareholders, or consumers). The choice of whether to collect a tax at the business level or the individual level depends on whether it is thought to be desirable to levy different taxes on different individuals. A business-level tax, whether levied on income or consumption, can be collected “at source”—that is, where it is generated—so there can be many fewer tax filers and returns to administer. Business-level taxes cannot, however, directly tax different individuals at different rates. Individual-level taxes can allow for distinctions between different individuals; for example, standard deductions or graduated rates can be used to tax individuals with low income (or consumption) at a lower rate than individuals with greater income (or consumption). However, individual-level taxes require more tax returns, impose higher compliance costs, and would generally require a larger tax administration system. A national retail sales tax, a consumption value-added tax, and an income value-added tax are examples of taxes that would be collected only at the business level. A personal consumption tax and an integrated individual income tax are examples of taxes that would be collected only at the individual level. The “flat tax” proposed by economists Robert Hall and Alvin Rabushka that has received attention in recent years is an example of a tax collected at both the business and individual level. Our current system for taxing corporate-source income involves taxation at both the corporate and individual level in a manner that results in the double taxation of the same income. Under a pure worldwide tax system the United States would tax the income of U.S. corporations, as it is earned, regardless of where it is earned, and at the same time provide a foreign tax credit that ensures that the combined rate of tax that a corporation pays to all governments on each dollar of income is exactly equal to the U.S. corporate tax rate. Some basic differences between the current U.S. tax system and a pure worldwide system are that (1) in many cases the U.S. system permits corporations to defer U.S. tax on their foreign-source income until it is repatriated and (2) the U.S. foreign tax credit is limited to the amount of U.S. tax that would be due on a corporation’s foreign-source income. In cases where the rate of foreign tax on a corporation’s income exceeds the U.S. tax rate, the corporation is left paying the higher rate of tax. Under a pure territorial tax system the United States would simply exempt all foreign-source income. (No major country has a pure territorial system; they all tax mobile forms of foreign-source income, such as royalties and income from securities.) The current U.S. tax system has some features that result in some cases in treatment similar to what would exist under a territorial system. First, corporations can defer U.S. tax indefinitely on certain foreign-source income, as long as they keep it reinvested abroad. Second, in certain cases U.S. corporations are able to use the excess credits that they earned for taxes they paid to high-tax countries to completely offset any U.S. tax that they would normally have to pay on income they earned in low-tax countries. As a result, that income from low-tax countries remains untaxed by the United States—just as it would be under a territorial system. In fact, there are some cases where U.S. corporations enjoy tax treatment that is more favorable than under a territorial system. This occurs when they pay no U.S. tax on foreign-source income yet are still able to deduct expenses allocable to that income. For example, a U.S. parent corporation can borrow money and invest it in a foreign subsidiary. The parent corporation generally can deduct its interest payments from its U.S. taxes even if it defers U.S. tax on the subsidiary’s income by leaving it overseas. Proponents of a worldwide tax system and proponents of a territorial system both argue that their preferred systems would provide important forms of tax neutrality. Under a pure worldwide system all of the income that a U.S. corporation earns abroad would be taxed at the same effective rate that a corporation earning the same amount of income domestically would pay. Such a tax system is neutral in the sense that it does not influence the decision of U.S. corporations to invest abroad or at home. If the U.S. had a pure territorial tax system all of the income that U.S. corporations earn in a particular country would be taxed at the same rate as corporations that are residents of that country. The pure territorial system is neutral in the specific sense that U.S. corporations investing in a foreign country would not be at a disadvantage relative to corporations residing in that country or relative to other foreign corporations investing there. In a world where each country sets its own tax rules it is impossible to achieve both types of neutrality at the same time, so tradeoffs are unavoidable. A change from the current tax system to a pure territorial one is likely to have mixed effects on tax compliance and administration. On the one hand, a pure worldwide tax system, or even the current system, may preserve the U.S. tax base better than a territorial system would because U.S. taxpayers would have greater incentive under a territorial system to shift income and investment into low-tax jurisdictions via transfer pricing. On the other hand, a pure territorial system may be less complex for IRS to administer and for taxpayers to comply with than the current tax system because there would be no need for the antideferral rules or the foreign tax credit, which are among the most complex features of the current system. Broad-based consumption taxes can differ depending on whether they are imposed under a destination principle, which holds that goods and services should be taxed in the countries where they are consumed, or an origin principle, which holds that goods and services should be taxed in the countries where they are produced. In the long run, after markets have adjusted, neither type of tax would have a significant effect on the U.S. trade balance. This is true for a destination-based tax because products consumed in the United States would be taxed at the same rate, regardless of where they were produced. Therefore, such a tax would not influence a consumer’s choice between buying a car produced in the United States or one imported from Japan. And at the same time, U.S. exports of cars would not be affected by the tax because they would be exempted. An origin-based consumption tax would not affect the trade balance because the tax effects that taxes have on prices would ultimately be countered by the same price adjustment mechanism that we discussed earlier with respect to targeted tax subsidies for exports. A national retail sales tax limited to final consumption goods would be a destination-principle tax; it would tax imports when sold at retail in this country and would not tax exports. Value-added taxes can be designed as either destination or origin-principle taxes. A personal consumption tax, collected at the individual level, would apply to U.S. residents or citizens and could be formulated to tax their consumption regardless of whether it is done domestically or overseas. Under such a system, income earned abroad would be taxable but funds saved or invested abroad would be deductible. In that case, foreign- produced goods imported into the United States or consumed by U.S. citizens abroad would be taxed. U.S. exports would only be taxed to the extent that they are consumed by U.S. citizens abroad. A wide range of options exist for moving from the current business tax system to an alternative one, and the way that any transition is formulated could have significant effects for economic efficiency, equity, taxpayer compliance burden, and tax administration. For example, one transition issue involves whether tax credits and other tax benefits already earned under the current tax would be made available under a new system. Businesses that are deducting depreciation under the current system would not have the opportunity to continue depreciating their capital goods under a VAT unless special rules were included to permit it. Similar problems could arise with businesses’ carrying forward net operating losses and recovering unclaimed tax credits. Depending on how these and other issues are addressed, taxpayer compliance burden and tax administration responsibilities could be greater during the transition period than they currently are or than they would be once the transition ends. Transition rules could also substantially reduce the new system’s tax base, thereby requiring higher tax rates during the transition if revenue neutrality were to be achieved. Our publication, Understanding the Tax Reform Debate: Background, Criteria, and Questions, may be useful in guiding policymakers as they consider tax reform proposals. It was designed to aid policymakers in thinking about how to develop tax policy for the 21st century. The criteria for a good tax system, which our report discusses, provide the basis for a set of principles that should guide Congress as it considers the choices and tradeoffs involved in tax system reform. And, as I also noted earlier, proposals for reforming business taxation cannot be evaluated without considering how that business taxation will interact with and complement the other elements of our overall future tax system. The proposed system should raise sufficient revenue over time to fund our expected expenditures. As I mentioned earlier, we will fall woefully short of achieving this end if current spending or revenue trends are not altered. Although we clearly must restructure major entitlement programs and the basis of other federal spending, it is unlikely that our long-term fiscal challenge will be resolved solely by cutting spending. The proposal should look to future needs. Like many spending programs, the current tax system was developed in a profoundly different time. We live now in a much more global economy, with highly mobile capital, and with investment options available to ordinary citizens that were not even imagined decades ago. We have growing concentrations of income and wealth. More firms operate multinationally and willingly move operations and capital around the world as they see best for their firms. As an adjunct to looking forward when making reforms, better information on existing commitments and promises must be coupled with estimates of the long-term discounted net present value costs from spending and tax commitments comprising longer-term exposures for the federal budget beyond the existing 10-year budget projection window. The tax base should be as broad as possible. Broad-based tax systems with minimal exceptions have many advantages. Fewer exceptions generally means less complexity, less compliance cost, less economic efficiency loss, and by increasing transparency may improve equity or perceptions of equity. This suggests that eliminating or consolidating numerous tax expenditures must be considered. In many cases tax preferences are simply a form of “back-door spending.” We need to be sure that the benefits achieved from having these special provisions are worth the associated revenue losses just as we must ensure that outlay programs— which may be attempting to achieve the same purposes as tax expenditures—achieve outcomes commensurate with their costs. And it is important to supplement these cost-benefit evaluations with analyses of distributional effects—i.e., who bears the costs of the preferences and who receives the benefits. To the extent tax expenditures are retained, consideration should be given to whether they could be better targeted to meet an identified need. If we must raise revenues, doing so from a broad base and a lower rate will help minimize economic efficiency costs. Broad-based tax systems can yield the same revenue as more narrowly based systems at lower tax rates. The combination of less direct intervention in the marketplace from special tax preferences, and the lower rates possible from broad-based systems, can have substantial benefits for economic efficiency. For instance, one commonly cited rule of thumb regarding economic efficiency costs of tax increases is that they rise proportionately faster than the tax rates. In other words, a 10 percent tax increase could raise the economic efficiency costs of a tax system by much more than 10 percent. Aside from the base-broadening that minimizes targeted tax preferences favoring specific types of investment or other business behavior, it is also desirable on the grounds of economic efficiency to extend the principle of tax neutrality to the broader structural features of a business tax system. For example, improvements in economic efficiency can also be gained by avoiding differences in tax treatment, such as the differences in the current system based on legal form of organization, source of financing, and the nature and location of foreign operations. Removing such differences can shift resources to more productive uses, increasing economic performance and the standard of living of Americans. Shifting resources to more productive uses can result in a step up in the level of economic activity which would be measured as a one-time increase in the rate of growth. Tax changes that increase efficiency can also increase the long-term rate of economic growth if they increase the rate of technological change; however, not all efficiency-increasing tax changes will do so. Impact on the standard of living of Americans is also a useful criterion for evaluating policies to improve U.S. competitiveness. As was discussed earlier, narrower goals and policies, such as increasing the U.S. balance of trade through targeted tax breaks aimed at encouraging exports, are generally viewed as ineffective by economists. What determines the standard of living of Americans and how it compares to the standard of living in other countries is the productivity of American workers and capital. That productivity is determined by factors such as education, technological innovation, and the amount of investment in the U.S. economy. Tax policy can contribute to American productivity in several ways. One, discussed in this statement, is through neutral taxation of investment alternatives. Another, which I have discussed on many occasions, is through fiscal policy. Borrowing to finance persistent federal deficits absorbs savings from the private sector reducing funds available for investment. Higher saving and investment from a more balanced fiscal policy would contribute to increased productivity and a higher standard of living for Americans over the long term. A reformed business tax system should have attributes associated with high compliance rates. Because any tax system can be subject to tax gaps, the administrability of reformed systems should be considered as part of the debate for change. In general, a reformed system is most likely to have a small tax gap if the system has few tax preferences or complex provisions and taxable transactions are transparent. Transparency in the context of tax administration is best achieved when third parties report information both to the taxpayer and the tax administrator. Minimizing tax code complexity has the potential to reduce noncompliance for at least three broad reasons. First, it could help taxpayers to comply voluntarily with more certainty, reducing inadvertent errors by those who want to comply but are confused because of complexity. Second, it may limit opportunities for tax evasion, reducing intentional noncompliance by taxpayers who can misuse the complex code provisions to hide their noncompliance or to achieve ends through tax shelters. Third, reducing tax-code complexity could improve taxpayers’ willingness to comply voluntarily. Finally, the consideration of transition rules needs to be an integral part of the design of a new system. The effects of these rules can be too significant to leave them simply as an afterthought in the reform process. The problems that I have reviewed today relating to the compliance costs, efficiency costs, equity, and tax gap associated with the current business tax system would seem to make a strong case for a comprehensive review and reform of our tax policy. Further, businesses operate in a world that is profoundly different—more competitive and more global—than when many of the existing provisions of the tax code were adopted. Despite numerous and repeated calls for reform, progress has been slow. I discussed reasons for the slow progress in a previous hearing on individual tax reform before this committee. One reason why reform is difficult to accomplish is that the provisions of the tax code that generate compliance costs, efficiency costs, the tax gap and inequities also benefit many taxpayers. Reform is also difficult because, even when there is agreement on the amount of revenue to raise, there are differing opinions on the appropriate balance among the often conflicting objectives of equity, efficiency, and administrability. This, in turn, leads to widely divergent views on even the basic direction of reform. However, I have described some basic principles that ought to guide business tax reform. One of them is revenue sufficiency. Fiscal necessity, prompted by the nation’s unsustainable fiscal path, will eventually force changes to our spending and tax policies. We must fundamentally rethink policies and everything must be on the table. Tough choices will have to be made about the appropriate degree of emphasis on cutting back federal programs versus increasing tax revenue. Other principles, such as broadening the tax base and otherwise promoting tax neutrality, could help improve economic performance. While economic growth alone will not solve our long-term fiscal problems, an improvement in our overall economic performance makes dealing with those problems easier. The recent report of the President’s Advisory Panel on Federal Tax Reform recommended two different tax reform plans. Although each plan is intended to improve economic efficiency and simplify the tax system, neither of them addresses the growing imbalance between federal spending and revenues that I have highlighted. One approach for getting the process of comprehensive fiscal reform started would be through the establishment of a credible, capable, and bipartisan commission, to examine options for a combination of selected entitlement and tax reform issues. Mr. Chairman and Members of the Committee, this concludes my statement. I would be pleased to answer any questions you may have at this time.

Washington, D.C.: January 1992. Simple, Fair, and Pro-Growth: Proposals to Fix America’s Tax System. Washington, D.C.: November 2005. Over the past decade, several proposals for fundamental tax reform have been put forward. These proposals would significantly change tax rates, the tax base, and the level of tax (whether taxes are collected from individuals, businesses, or both). Some of the proposals would replace the federal income tax with some type of consumption tax levied only on businesses. Consumption taxes levied only on businesses include retail sales taxes (RST) and value-added taxes (VAT). The flat tax would also change the tax base to consumption but include both a relatively simple individual tax along with a business tax. A personal consumption tax, a consumption tax levied primarily on individuals, has also been proposed. Similar changes in the level at which taxes are collected could be made while retaining an income tax base. This appendix provides a brief description of several of these proposals. The consumption tax that Americans are most familiar with is the retail sales tax, which in many states, is levied when goods or services are purchased at the retail level. The RST is a consumption tax because only goods purchased by consumers are taxed, and sales to businesses, including sales of investment goods, are generally exempt from tax. In contrast to an income tax, then, income that is saved is not taxed until it is used for consumption. Under a national RST, different tax rates could be applied to different goods, and the sale of some goods could carry a zero tax rate (exemption). However, directly taxing different individuals at different rates for the same good would be very difficult. A consumption VAT, which like the RST, is a business-level consumption tax levied directly on the purchase of goods and services. The two taxes differ in the manner in which the tax is collected and paid. In contrast to a retail sales tax, sales of goods and services to consumers and to businesses are taxable under a VAT. However, businesses can either deduct the amount of their purchases of goods and services from other businesses (under a subtraction VAT) or can claim a credit for tax paid on purchases from other businesses (under a credit VAT). Under either method, sales between businesses do not generate net tax liability under a VAT because the amount included in the tax base by businesses selling goods is equal to the amount deducted by the business purchasing goods. The only sales that generate net revenue for the government are sales between businesses and consumers, which is the same case as the RST. An income VAT would move the taxation of wage income to the business level as well. No individual returns would be necessary, so the burden of complying with the tax law would be eliminated for individuals. An income VAT would not allow businesses to deduct dividends, interest, or wages, so the income VAT remitted by businesses would include tax on these types of income. Calculations would not have to be made for different individuals, which would simplify tax administration and compliance burdens but not allow for treating different individuals differently. The flat tax was developed in the early 1980s by economists Robert Hall and Alvin Rabushka. The Hall-Rabushka flat tax proposal includes both an individual tax and a business tax. As described by Hall and Rabushka, the flat tax is a modification of a VAT; the modifications make the tax more progressive (less regressive) than a VAT. In particular, the business tax base is designed to be the same as that of a VAT, except that businesses are allowed to deduct wages and retirement income paid out as well as purchases from other businesses. Wage and retirement income is then taxed when received by individuals at the same rate as the business tax rate. By including this individual-level tax as well as the business tax, standard deductions can be made available to individuals. Individuals with less wage and retirement income than the standard deduction amounts would not owe any tax. A personal consumption tax would look much like a personal income tax. The major difference between the two is that under the consumption tax, taxpayers would include all income received, amounts borrowed, and cash flows received from the sale of assets, and then deduct the amount they saved. The remaining amount would be a measure of the taxpayer’s consumption over the year. When funds are withdrawn from bank accounts, or stocks or bonds are sold, both the original amount saved and interest earned are taxable because they are available for consumption. If withdrawn funds are reinvested in another qualified account or in stock or bonds, the taxable amount of the withdrawal would be offset by the deduction for the same amount that is reinvested. While the personal consumption tax would look like a personal income tax, the tax base would be the same as an RST. Instead of collecting tax on each sale of consumer products at the business level, a personal consumption tax would tax individuals annually on the sum of all their purchases of consumption goods. Because it is an individual-level tax, different tax rates could be applied to different individuals so that the tax could be made more progressive, and other taxpayer characteristics, such as family size, could be taken into account if desired.

Businesses also play a crucial role in collecting taxes from individuals, through withholding and information reporting. However, the design of the current system of business taxation is widely seen as flawed. It distorts investment decisions, hurting the performance of the economy. Its complexity imposes planning and record keeping costs, facilitates tax shelters, and provides potential cover for those who want to cheat. Not surprisingly, business tax reform is part of the debate about overall tax reform. The debate is occurring at a time when long-range projections show that, without a policy change, the gap between spending and revenues will widen. This testimony reviews the nation's long term fiscal imbalance and what is wrong with the current system of business taxation and provides some principles that ought to guide the debate about business tax reform. This statement is based on previously published GAO work and reviews of relevant literature. The size of business tax revenues makes them very relevant to any plan for addressing the nation's long-term fiscal imbalance. Reexamining both federal spending and revenues, including business tax policy and compliance must be part of a multipronged approach to address the imbalance. Some features of current business taxes channel investments into tax-favored activities and away from more productive activities and, thereby, reduce the economic well-being of all Americans. Complexity in business tax laws imposes costs of its own, facilitates tax shelters, and provides potential cover for those who want to cheat. IRS's latest estimates show a business tax gap of at least $141 billion for 2001. This in turn undermines confidence in the fairness of our tax system--citizens' confidence that their friends, neighbors, and business competitors pay their fair share of taxes. Principles that should guide the business tax reform debate include: (1) The proposed system should raise sufficient revenue over time to fund our current and future expected expenditures. (2) The tax base should be as broad as possible, which helps to minimize overall tax rates. (3) The proposed system should improve compliance rates by reducing tax preferences and complexity and increasing transparency. (4) To the extent other goals, such as equity and simplicity, allow, the tax system should aim for neutrality by not favoring some business activities over others. More neutral tax policy has the potential to enhance economic growth, increase productivity and improve the competitiveness of the U.S. economy in terms of standard of living. (5) The consideration of transition rules must be an integral part of any reform proposal.\"}\n",
      "{'document': 'There are some similarities in how Medicare pays ASCs and hospital outpatient departments for the procedures they perform. However, the methods used by CMS to calculate the payment rates in each system, as well as the mechanisms used to revise the Medicare payment rates, differ. In 1980, legislation was enacted that enabled ASCs to bill Medicare for certain surgical procedures provided to Medicare beneficiaries. Under the ASC payment system, Medicare pays a predetermined, and generally all- inclusive, amount per procedure to the facility. The approximately 2,500 surgical procedures that ASCs may bill for under Medicare are assigned to one of nine payment groups that contain procedures with similar costs, but not necessarily clinical similarities. All procedures assigned to one payment group are paid at the same rate. Under the Medicare payment system, when more than one procedure is performed at the same time, the ASC receives a payment for each of the procedures. However, the procedure that has the highest payment rate receives 100 percent of the applicable payment, and each additional procedure receives 50 percent of the applicable payment. The Medicare payment for a procedure performed at an ASC is intended to cover the direct costs for a procedure, such as nursing and technician services, drugs, medical and surgical supplies and equipment, anesthesia materials, and diagnostic services (including imaging services), and the indirect costs associated with the procedure, including use of the facility and related administrative services. The ASC payment for a procedure does not include payment for implantable devices or prosthetics related to the procedure; ASCs may bill separately for those items. In addition, the payment to the ASC does not include payment for professional services associated with the procedure; the physician who performs the procedure and the anesthesiologist or anesthetist bill Medicare directly for their services. Finally, the ASC payment does not include payment for certain other services that are not directly related to performing the procedure and do not occur during the time that the procedure takes place, such as some laboratory, X-ray, and other diagnostic tests. Because these additional services are not ASC procedures, they may be performed by another provider. In those cases, Medicare makes payments to those providers for the additional services. For example, a laboratory service needed to evaluate a tissue sample removed during an ASC procedure is not included in the ASC payment. The provider that evaluated the tissue sample would bill and receive payment from Medicare for that service. Because ASCs receive one inclusive payment for the procedure performed and its associated services, such as drugs, they generally include on their Medicare claim only the procedure performed. In 1997, legislation was enacted that required the implementation of a prospective payment system for hospital outpatient departments; the OPPS was implemented in August 2000. Although ASCs perform only procedures, hospital outpatient departments provide a much broader array of services, including diagnostic services, such as X-rays and laboratory tests, and emergency room and clinic visits. Each of the approximately 5,500 services, including procedures, that hospital outpatient departments perform is assigned to one of over 800 APC groups with other services with clinical and cost similarities for payment under the OPPS. All services assigned to one APC group are paid the same rate. Similar to ASCs, when hospitals perform multiple procedures at the same time, they receive 100 percent of the applicable payment for the procedure that has the highest payment rate, and 50 percent of the applicable payment for each additional procedure, subject to certain exceptions. Like payments to ASCs, payment for a procedure under the OPPS is intended to cover the costs of the use of the facility, nursing and technician services, most drugs, medical and surgical supplies and equipment, anesthesia materials, and administrative costs. Medicare payment to a hospital for a procedure does not include professional services for physicians or other nonphysician practitioners. These services are paid for separately by Medicare. However, there are some differences between ASC and OPPS payments for procedures. Under the OPPS, hospital outpatient departments generally may not bill separately for implantable devices related to the procedure, but they may bill separately for additional services that are directly related to the procedure, such as certain drugs and diagnostic services, including X-rays. Hospital outpatient departments also may bill separately for additional services that are not directly related to the procedure and do not occur during the procedure, such as laboratory services to evaluate a tissue sample. Because they provide a broader array of services, and because CMS has encouraged hospitals to report all services provided during a procedure on their Medicare claims for rate-setting purposes, hospital claims may provide more detail about the services delivered during a procedure than ASC claims do. CMS set the initial 1982 ASC payment rates based on cost and charge data from 40 ASCs. At that time, there were about 125 ASCs in operation. Procedures were placed into four payment groups, and all procedures in a group were paid the same rate. When the ASC payment system was first established, federal law required CMS to review the payment rates periodically. In 1986, CMS conducted an ASC survey to gather cost and charge data. In 1990, using these data, CMS revised the payment rates and increased the number of payment groups to eight. A ninth payment group was established in 1991. These groups are still in use, although some procedures have been added to or deleted from the ASC-approved list. Although payments have not been revised using ASC cost data since 1990, the payment rates have been periodically updated for inflation. In 1994, Congress required that CMS conduct a survey of ASC costs no later than January 1, 1995, and thereafter every 5 years, to revise ASC payment rates. CMS conducted a survey in 1994 to collect ASC cost data. In 1998, CMS proposed revising ASC payment rates based on the 1994 survey data and assigned procedures performed at ASCs into payment groups that were comparable to the payment groups it was developing for the same procedures under the OPPS. However, CMS did not implement the proposal, and, as a result, the ASC payment system was not revised using the 1994 data. In 2003, MMA eliminated the requirement to conduct ASC surveys every 5 years and required CMS to implement a revised ASC payment system no later than January 1, 2008. During the course of our work, in August 2006, CMS published a proposed rule that would revise the ASC payment system effective January 1, 2008. In this proposed rule, CMS bases the revised ASC payment rates on the OPPS APC groups. However, the payment rates would be lower for ASCs. The initial OPPS payment rates, implemented in August 2000, were based on hospitals’ 1996 costs. To determine the OPPS payment rates, CMS first calculates each hospital’s cost for each service by multiplying the charge for that service by a cost-to-charge ratio computed from the hospital’s most recently reported data. After calculating the cost of each service for each hospital, the services are grouped by their APC assignment, and a median cost for each APC group is calculated from the median costs of all services assigned to it. Using the median cost, CMS assigns each APC group a weight based on its median cost relative to the median cost of all other APCs. To obtain a payment rate for each APC group, CMS multiplies the relative weight by a factor that converts it to a dollar amount. Beginning in 2002, as required by law, the APC group payment rates have been revised annually based on the latest charge and cost data. In addition, the payment rates for services paid under the OPPS receive an annual inflation update. We found many similarities in the additional services provided by ASCs and hospital outpatient departments with the top 20 procedures. Of the additional services billed with a procedure, few resulted in an additional payment in one setting but not the other. Hospitals were paid for some of the related additional services they billed with the procedures. In the ASC setting, other providers billed Medicare for these services and received payment for them. In our analysis of Medicare claims, we found many similarities in the additional services billed in the ASC or hospital outpatient department setting with the top 20 procedures. The similar additional services are illustrated in the following four categories of services: additional procedures, laboratory services, radiology services, and anesthesia services. First, one or more additional procedures was billed with a procedure performed in either the ASC or hospital outpatient department setting for 14 of the top 20 procedures. The proportion of time each additional procedure was billed in each setting was similar. For example, when a hammertoe repair procedure was performed, our analysis indicated that another procedure to correct a bunion was billed 11 percent of the time in the ASC setting, and in the hospital outpatient setting, the procedure to correct a bunion was billed 13 percent of the time. Similarly, when a diagnostic colonoscopy was performed, an upper gastrointestinal (GI) endoscopy was billed 11 percent of the time in the ASC setting, and in the hospital setting, the upper GI endoscopy was billed 12 percent of the time. For 11 of these 14 procedures, the proportion of time each additional procedure was billed differed by less than 10 percentage points between the two settings. For the 3 remaining procedures, the percentage of time that an additional procedure was billed did not vary by more than 25 percentage points between the two settings. See appendix III for a complete list of the additional procedures billed and the proportion of time they were billed in each setting. Second, laboratory services were billed with 10 of the top 20 procedures in the hospital outpatient department setting and 7 of the top 20 procedures in the ASC setting. While these services were almost always billed by the hospital in the outpatient setting, they were typically not billed by the ASCs. These laboratory services were present in our analysis in the ASC setting because they were performed and billed by another Medicare part B provider. Third, four different radiology services were billed with 8 of the top 20 procedures. Radiology services were billed with 5 procedures in the ASC setting and with 8 procedures in the hospital outpatient department setting. The radiology services generally were included on the hospital outpatient department bills but rarely were included on the ASC bills. Similar to laboratory services, hospital outpatient departments billed for radiology services that they performed in addition to the procedures. When radiology services were billed with procedures in the ASC setting, these services generally were performed and billed by another part B provider. Fourth, anesthesia services were billed with 17 of the top 20 procedures in either the ASC or hospital outpatient settings and with 14 procedures in both settings. In virtually every case in the ASC setting, and most cases in the hospital outpatient department setting, these services were billed by another part B provider. According to our analysis, ASCs did not generally include any services other than the procedures they performed on their bills. However, in the hospital outpatient setting, some additional services were included on the hospitals’ bills. We believe this is a result of the structure of the two payment systems. As ASCs generally receive payment from Medicare only for procedures, they typically include only those procedures on their bills. In contrast, hospital outpatient departments’ bills often include many of the individual items or services they provide as a part of a procedure because CMS has encouraged them to do so, whether the items or services are included in the OPPS payment or paid separately. With the exception of additional procedures, there were few separate payments that could be made for additional services provided with the top 20 procedures because most of the services in our analysis were included in the Medicare payment to the ASC or hospital. Under both the Medicare ASC and OPPS payment systems, when more than one procedure is performed at the same time, the facility receives 100 percent of the applicable payment for the procedure that has the highest payment rate and 50 percent of the applicable payment for each additional procedure. As this policy is applicable to both settings, for those instances in our analysis when an additional procedure was performed with one of the top 20 procedures in either setting, the ASC or hospital outpatient department received 100 percent of the payment for the procedure with the highest payment rate and 50 percent of the payment for each lesser paid procedure. Individual drugs were billed by hospital outpatient departments for most of the top 20 procedures, although they were not present on the claims from ASCs, likely because ASCs generally cannot receive separate Medicare payments for individual drugs. However, none of the individual drugs billed by the hospital outpatient departments in our analysis resulted in an additional payment to the hospitals. In each case, the cost of the particular drug was included in the Medicare payment for the procedure. In the case of the laboratory services billed with procedures in the ASC and hospital outpatient department settings, those services were not costs included in the payment for the procedure in either setting and were paid separately in each case. For both settings, the payment was made to the provider that performed the service. In the case of the hospital outpatient department setting, the payment was generally made to the hospital, while, for procedures performed at ASCs, payment was made to another provider who performed the service. Of the four radiology services in our analysis, three were similar to the laboratory services in that they are not included in the cost of the procedure and are separately paid services under Medicare. Therefore, when hospitals provided these services, they received payment for them. In the ASC setting, these services were typically billed by a provider other than the ASC, and the provider received payment for them. The fourth radiology service is included in the payment for the procedure with which it was associated. Therefore, no separate payment was made to either ASCs or hospital outpatient departments. With regard to anesthesia services, most services were billed by and paid to a provider other than an ASC or hospital. As a group, the costs of procedures performed in ASCs have a relatively consistent relationship with the costs of the APC groups to which they would be assigned under the OPPS. That is, the APC groups accurately reflect the relative costs of procedures performed in ASCs. We found that the ASC-to-APC cost ratios were more tightly distributed around their median cost ratio than the OPPS-to-APC cost ratios were around their median cost ratio. Specifically, 45 percent of all procedures in our analysis fell within 0.10 points of the ASC-to-APC median cost ratio, and 33 percent of procedures fell within 0.10 points of the OPPS-to-APC median cost ratio. However, the costs of procedures in ASCs are substantially lower than costs for the same procedures in the hospital outpatient setting. The APC groups reflect the relative costs of procedures provided by ASCs as well as they reflect the relative costs of procedures provided in the hospital outpatient department setting. In our analysis, we listed the procedures performed at ASCs and calculated the ratio of the cost of each procedure to the cost of the APC group to which it would have been assigned, referred to as the ASC-to-APC cost ratio. We then calculated similar cost ratios for the same procedures exclusively within the OPPS. To determine an OPPS-to-APC cost ratio, we divided individual procedures’ median costs, as calculated by CMS for the OPPS, by the median cost of their APC group. Our analysis of the cost ratios showed that the ASC-to-APC cost ratios were more tightly distributed around their median than were the OPPS-to-APC cost ratios; that is, there were more of them closer to the median. Specifically, 45 percent of procedures performed in ASCs fell within a 0.10 point range of the ASC-to-APC median cost ratio, and 33 percent of those procedures fell within a 0.10 point range of the OPPS-to-APC median cost ratio in the hospital outpatient department setting (see figs. 1 and 2). Therefore, there is less variation in the ASC setting between individual procedures’ costs and the costs of their assigned APC groups than there is in the hospital outpatient department setting. From this outcome, we determined that the OPPS APC groups could be used to pay for procedures in ASCs. The median costs of procedures performed in ASCs were generally lower than the median costs of their corresponding APC group under the OPPS. Among all procedures in our analysis, the median ASC-to-APC cost ratio was 0.39. The ASC-to-APC cost ratios ranged from 0.02 to 3.34. When weighted by Medicare volume based on 2004 claims data, the median ASC- to-APC cost ratio was 0.84. We determined that the median OPPS-to-APC cost ratio was 1.04. This analysis shows that when compared to the median cost of the same APC group, procedures performed in ASCs had substantially lower costs than when those same procedures were performed in hospital outpatient departments. Generally, there are many similarities between the additional services provided in ASCs and hospital outpatient departments with one of the top 20 procedures, and few resulted in an additional Medicare payment to ASCs or hospital outpatient departments. Although costs for individual procedures vary, in general, the median costs for procedures are lower in ASCs, relative to the median costs of their APC groups, than the median costs for the same procedures in the hospital outpatient department setting. The APC groups in the OPPS reflect the relative costs of procedures performed in ASCs in the same way that they reflect the relative costs of the same procedures when they are performed in hospital outpatient departments. Therefore, the APC groups could be applied to procedures performed in ASCs, and the OPPS could be used as the basis for an ASC payment system, eliminating the need for ASC surveys and providing for an annual revision of the ASC payment groups. We recommend that the Administrator of CMS implement a payment system for procedures performed in ASCs based on the OPPS. The Administrator should take into account the lower relative costs of procedures performed in ASCs compared to hospital outpatient departments in determining ASC payment rates. We received written comments on a draft of this report from CMS (see app. IV). We also received oral comments from external reviewers representing two ASC industry organizations, AAASC and FASA. In commenting on a draft of this report, CMS stated that our recommendation is consistent with its August 2006 proposed revisions to the ASC payment system. Industry representatives who reviewed a draft of this report did not agree or disagree with our recommendation for executive action. They did, however, provide several comments on the draft report. The industry representatives noted that we did not analyze the survey results to examine differences in per-procedure costs among single-specialty and multi-specialty ASCs. Regarding this comment, we initially considered developing our survey sample stratified by ASC specialty type. However, because accurate data identifying ASCs’ specialties do not exist, we were unable to stratify our survey sample by specialty type. The industry representatives asked us to provide more explanation in our scope and methodology regarding our development of a relative weight scale for Medicare ASC-approved procedures to capture the general variation in resources associated with performing different procedures. We expanded the discussion of how we developed the relative weight scale in our methodology section. Reviewers also made technical comments, which we incorporated where appropriate. We are sending a copy of this report to the Administrator of CMS and appropriate congressional committees. The report is available at no charge on GAO’s Web site at http://www.gao.gov. We will also make copies available to others on request. If you or your staff members have any questions about this report, please contact me at (202) 512-7119 or kingk@gao.gov. Contact points for our Offices of Congressional Relations and Public Affairs may be found on the last page of this report. GAO staff members who made significant contributions to this report are listed in appendix V. The Medicare payment rates for ambulatory surgical centers (ASC), along with those of other facilities, are adjusted to account for the variation in labor costs across the country. To calculate payment rates for individual ASCs, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) calculates the share of total costs that are labor-related and then adjusts ASCs’ labor- related share of costs based on a wage index calculated for specific geographic areas across the country. The wage index reflects how the average wage for health care personnel in each geographic area compares to the national average health care personnel wage. The geographic areas are intended to represent the separate labor markets in which health care facilities compete for employees. In setting the initial ASC payment rates for 1982, CMS determined from the first survey of ASCs that one-third of their costs were labor-related. The labor-related costs included employee salaries and fringe benefits, contractual personnel, and owners’ compensation for duties performed for the facility. To determine the payment rates for each individual ASC, CMS multiplied one-third of the payment rate for each procedure—the labor- related portion—by the local area wage index. Each ASC received the base payment rate for two-thirds of the payment rate—the nonlabor-related portion—for each procedure. The sum of the labor-related and nonlabor- related portions equaled each ASC’s payment rate for each procedure. In 1990, when CMS revised the payment system based on a 1986 ASC survey, CMS found ASCs’ average labor-related share of costs to be 34.45 percent and used this percentage as the labor-related portion of the payment rate. In a 1998 proposed rule, CMS noted that ASCs’ share of labor-related costs as calculated from the 1994 ASC cost survey had increased to an average of 37.66 percent, slightly higher than the percentage calculated from the 1986 survey. However, CMS did not implement the 1998 proposal. Currently, the labor-related proportion of costs from CMS’s 1986 survey, 34.45 percent, is used for calculating ASC payment rates. Using 2004 cost data we received from 290 ASCs that responded to our survey request for information, we determined that the mean labor-related proportion of costs was 50 percent, and the range of the labor-related costs for the middle 50 percent of our ASC facilities was 43 percent to 57 percent of total costs. To compare the delivery of procedures between ASCs and hospital outpatient departments, we analyzed Medicare claims data from 2003. To compare the relative costs of procedures performed in ASCs and hospital outpatient departments, we collected cost and procedure data from 2004 from a sample of Medicare-participating ASCs. We also interviewed officials at CMS and representatives from ASC industry organizations, specifically, the American Association of Ambulatory Surgery Centers (AAASC) and FASA, physician specialty societies, and nine ASCs. To compare the delivery of additional services provided with procedures performed in ASCs and hospital outpatient departments, we identified all additional services frequently billed in each setting when one of the top 20 procedures with the highest Medicare ASC claims volume is performed. These procedures represented approximately 75 percent of all Medicare ASC claims in 2003. Using Medicare claims data for 2003, we identified beneficiaries receiving one of the top 20 procedures in either an ASC or hospital outpatient department, then identified any other claims for those beneficiaries from ASCs, hospital outpatient departments, durable medical equipment suppliers, and other Medicare part B providers. We identified claims for the beneficiaries on the day the procedure was performed and the day after. We created a list that included all additional services that were billed at least 10 percent of the time with each of the top 20 procedures when they were performed in ASCs. We created a similar list of additional services for each of the top 20 procedures when they were performed in hospital outpatient departments. We then compared the lists for each of the top 20 procedures between the two settings to determine whether there were similarities in the additional services that were billed to Medicare. To compare the Medicare payments for procedures performed in ASCs and hospital outpatient departments, we identified whether any additional services included in our analysis resulted in an additional payment. We used Medicare claims data from the National Claims History (NCH) files. These data, which are used by the Medicare program to make payments to health care providers, are closely monitored by both CMS and the Medicare contractors that process, review, and pay claims for Medicare services. The data are subject to various internal controls, including checks and edits performed by the contractors before claims are submitted to CMS for payment approval. Although we did not review these internal controls, we did assess the reliability of the NCH data. First, we reviewed all existing information about the data, including the data dictionary and file layouts. We also interviewed experts at CMS who regularly use the data for evaluation and analysis. We found the data to be sufficiently reliable for the purposes of this report. To compare the relative costs of procedures performed in ASCs and hospital outpatient departments, we first compiled information on ASCs’ costs and procedures performed. Because there were no recent existing data on ASC costs, we surveyed 600 ASCs, randomly selected from all ASCs, to obtain their 2004 cost and procedure data. We received response data from 397 ASC facilities. We assessed the reliability of these data through several means. We identified incomplete and inconsistent survey responses within individual surveys and placed follow-up calls to respondents to complete or verify their responses. To ensure that survey response data were accurately transferred to electronic files for our analytic purposes, two analysts independently entered all survey responses. Any discrepancies between the two sets of entered responses were resolved. We performed electronic testing for errors in accuracy and completeness, including an analysis of costs per procedure. As a result of our data reliability testing, we determined that data from 290 responding facilities were sufficiently reliable for our purposes. Our nonresponse analysis showed that there was no geographic bias among the facilities responding to our survey. The responding facilities performed more Medicare services than the average for all ASCs in our sample. To allocate ASCs’ total costs among the individual procedures they perform, we developed a method to allocate the portion of an ASC’s costs accounted for by each procedure. We constructed a relative weight scale for Medicare ASC-approved procedures that captures the general variation in resources associated with performing different procedures. The resources we used were the clinical staff time, surgical supplies, and surgical equipment used during the procedures. We used cost and quantity data on these resources from information CMS had collected for the purpose of setting the practice expense component of physician payment rates. For procedures for which CMS had no data on the resources used, we used information we collected from medical specialty societies and physicians who work for CMS. We summed the costs of the resources for each procedure and created a relative weight scale by dividing the total cost of each procedure by the average cost across all of the procedures. We assessed the reliability of these data through several means. We compared electronic CMS data with the original document sources for a large sample of records, performed electronic testing for errors in accuracy and completeness, and reviewed data for reasonableness. Based on these efforts, we determined that data were sufficiently reliable for our purposes. To calculate per-procedure costs with the data from the surveyed ASC facilities, we first deducted costs that Medicare considers unallowable, such as advertising and entertainment costs. (See fig. 3 for our per- procedure cost calculation methodology.) We also deducted costs for services that Medicare pays for separately, such as physician and nonphysician practitioner services. We then separated each facility’s total costs into its direct and indirect costs. We defined direct costs as those associated with the clinical staff, equipment, and supplies used during the procedure. Indirect costs included all remaining costs, such as support and administrative staff, building expenses, and outside services purchased. To allocate each facility’s direct costs across the procedures it performed, we applied our relative weight scale. We allocated indirect costs equally across all procedures performed by the facility. For each procedure performed by a responding ASC facility, we summed its allocated direct and indirect costs to determine a total cost for the procedure. To obtain a per-procedure cost across all ASCs, we arrayed the calculated costs for all ASCs performing that procedure and identified the median cost. To compare per-procedure costs for ASCs and hospital outpatient departments, we first obtained from CMS the list of ambulatory payment classification (APC) groups used for the outpatient prospective payment system (OPPS) and the procedures assigned to each APC group. We also obtained from CMS the OPPS median cost of each procedure and the median cost of each APC group. We then calculated a ratio between each procedure’s ASC median cost, as determined by the survey, and the median cost of each procedure’s corresponding APC group under the OPPS, referred to as the ASC-to-APC cost ratio. We also calculated a ratio between each ASC procedure’s median cost under the OPPS and the median cost of the procedure’s APC group, using the data obtained from CMS, referred to as the OPPS-to-APC cost ratio. To evaluate the difference in procedure costs between the two settings, we compared the ASC-to- APC and OPPS-to-APC cost ratios. To assess how well the relative costs of procedures in the OPPS, defined by their assignment to APC groups, reflect the relative costs of procedures in the ASC setting, we evaluated the distribution of the ASC-to-APC and OPPS-to-APC cost ratios. To calculate the percentage of labor-related costs among our sample ASCs, for each ASC, we divided total labor costs by total costs, after deducting costs not covered by Medicare’s facility payment. We then determined the range of the percentage of labor-related costs among all of our ASCs and between the 25th percentile and the 75th percentile, as well as the mean and median percentage of labor-related costs. We performed our work from April 2004 through October 2006 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards. Appendix III: Additional Procedures Billed with the Top 20 ASC Procedures, 2003 (percentage) N/A (percentage) In addition to the contact named above, key contributors to this report were Nancy A. Edwards, Assistant Director; Kevin Dietz; Beth Cameron Feldpush; Marc Feuerberg; and Nora Hoban.', 'summary': \"Medicare pays for surgical procedures performed at ambulatory surgical centers (ASC) and hospital outpatient departments through different payment systems. Although they perform a similar set of procedures, no comparison of ASC and hospital outpatient per-procedure costs has been conducted. The Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003 directed GAO to compare the relative costs of procedures furnished in ASCs to the relative costs of those procedures furnished in hospital outpatient departments, in particular, how accurately the payment groups used in the hospital outpatient prospective payment system (OPPS) reflect the relative costs of procedures performed in ASCs. To do this, GAO collected data from ASCs through a survey. GAO also obtained hospital outpatient data from the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS). GAO determined that the payment groups in the OPPS, known as ambulatory payment classification (APC) groups, accurately reflect the relative cost of procedures performed in ASCs. GAO calculated the ratio between each procedure's ASC median cost, as determined by GAO's survey, and the median cost of each procedure's corresponding APC group under the OPPS, referred to as the ASC-to-APC cost ratio. GAO also compared the OPPS median costs of those same procedures with the median costs of their APC groups, referred to as the OPPS-to-APC cost ratio. GAO's analysis of the ASC-to-APC and OPPS-to-APC cost ratios showed that 45 percent of all procedures in the analysis fell within a 0.10 point range of the ASC-to-APC median cost ratio, and 33 percent of procedures fell within a 0.10 point range of the OPPS-to-APC median cost ratio. These similar patterns of distribution around the median show that the APC groups reflect the relative costs of procedures provided by ASCs as well as they reflect the relative costs of procedures provided in hospital outpatient departments and can be used as the basis for the ASC payment system. GAO's analysis also identified differences in the cost of procedures in the two settings. The median cost ratio among all ASC procedures was 0.39 and when weighted by Medicare claims volume was 0.84. The median cost ratio for OPPS procedures was 1.04. Thus, the cost of procedures in ASCs is substantially lower than the corresponding cost in hospital outpatient departments.\"}\n",
      "{'document': 'IRS’s mission is to provide America’s taxpayers top-quality service by helping them to understand and meet their tax responsibilities and to enforce the law with integrity and fairness to all. During fiscal year 2015, IRS collected more than $3.3 trillion; processed more than 243 million tax returns and other forms; and issued more than $403 billion in tax refunds. IRS employs about 90,000 people in its Washington, D.C., headquarters and at more than 550 offices in all 50 states, U.S. territories, and some U.S. embassies and consulates. Each filing season IRS provides assistance to tens of millions of taxpayers over the phone, through written correspondence, online, and face-to-face. The scale of these operations alone presents challenges. In carrying out its mission, IRS relies extensively on computerized information systems, which it must effectively secure to protect sensitive financial and taxpayer data for the collection of taxes, processing of tax returns, and enforcement of federal tax laws. Accordingly, it is critical for IRS to effectively implement information security controls and an agency- wide information security program in accordance with federal law and guidance. Cyber incidents can adversely affect national security, damage public health and safety, and compromise sensitive information. Regarding IRS specifically, two recent incidents illustrate the impact on taxpayer and other sensitive information: In June 2015, the Commissioner of the IRS testified that unauthorized third parties had gained access to taxpayer information from its Get Transcript application. According to officials, criminals used taxpayer- specific data acquired from non-department sources to gain unauthorized access to information on approximately 100,000 tax accounts. These data included Social Security information, dates of birth, and street addresses. In an August 2015 update, IRS reported this number to be about 114,000, and that an additional 220,000 accounts had been inappropriately accessed. In a February 2016 update, the agency reported that an additional 390,000 accounts had been accessed. Thus, about 724,000 accounts were reportedly affected. The online Get Transcript service has been unavailable since May 2015. In March 2016, IRS stated that as part of its ongoing security review, it had temporarily suspended the Identity Protection Personal Identification Number (IP PIN) service on IRS.gov. The IP PIN is a single-use identification number provided to taxpayers who are victims of identity theft (IDT) to help prevent future IDT refund fraud. The service on IRS’s website allowed taxpayers to retrieve their IP PINs online by passing IRS’s authentication checks. These checks confirm taxpayer identity by asking for personal, financial and tax-related information. The IRS stated that it was conducting further review of the IP PIN service and is looking at further strengthening the security features before resuming service. As of April 7, the online service was still suspended. The Commissioner of Internal Revenue has overall responsibility for ensuring the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the information and systems that support the agency and its operations. Within IRS, the senior agency official responsible for information security is the Associate CIO, who heads the IRS Information Technology Cybersecurity organization. As we reported in March 2016, IRS has implemented numerous controls over key financial and tax processing systems; however, it had not always effectively implemented access and other controls, including elements of its information security program. Access controls are intended to prevent, limit, and detect unauthorized access to computing resources, programs, information, and facilities. These controls include identification and authentication, authorization, cryptography, audit and monitoring, and physical security controls, among others. In our most recent review we found that IRS had improved access controls, but some weaknesses remain. Identifying and authenticating users—such as through user account-password combinations—provides the basis for establishing accountability and controlling access to a system. IRS established policies for identification and authentication, including requiring multifactor authentication for local and network access accounts and establishing password complexity and expiration requirements. It also improved identification and authentication controls by, for example, expanding the use of an automated mechanism to centrally manage, apply, and verify password requirements. However, weaknesses in identification and authentication controls remained. For example, the agency used easily guessable passwords on servers supporting key systems. Authorization controls limit what actions users are able to perform after being allowed into a system and should be based on the concept of “least privilege,” granting users the least amount of rights and privileges necessary to perform their duties. While IRS established policies for authorizing access to its systems, it continued to permit excessive access in some cases. For example, users were granted rights and permissions in excess of what they needed to perform their duties, including for an application used to process electronic tax payment information and a database on a human resources system. Cryptography controls protect sensitive data and computer programs by rendering data unintelligible to unauthorized users and protecting the integrity of transmitted or stored data. IRS policies require the use of encryption and it continued to expand its use of encryption to protect sensitive data. However, key systems we reviewed had not been configured to encrypt sensitive user authentication data. Audit and monitoring is the regular collection, review, and analysis of events on systems and networks in order to detect, respond to, and investigate unusual activity. IRS established policies and procedures for auditing and monitoring its systems and continued to enhance its capability by, for example, implementing an automated mechanism to log user activity on its access request and approval system. But it had not established logging for two key applications used to support the transfer of financial data and access and manage taxpayer accounts; nor was the agency consistently maintaining key system and application audit plans. Physical security controls, such as physical access cards, limit access to an organization’s overall facility and areas housing sensitive IT components. IRS established policies for physically protecting its computer resources and physical security controls at its enterprise computer centers, such as a dedicated guard force at each of its computer centers. However, the agency had yet to address weaknesses in its review of access lists for both employees and visitors to sensitive areas. IRS also had weaknesses in configuration management controls, which are intended to prevent unauthorized changes to information system resources (e.g., software and hardware) and provide assurance that systems are configured and operating securely. Specifically, while IRS developed policies for managing the configuration of its information technology (IT) systems and improved some configuration management controls, it did not, for example, ensure security patch updates were applied in a timely manner to databases supporting 2 key systems we reviewed, including a patch that had been available since August 2012. To its credit, IRS had established contingency plans for the systems we reviewed, which help ensure that when unexpected events occur, critical operations can continue without interruption or can be promptly resumed, and that information resources are protected. Specifically, IRS had established policies for developing contingency plans for its information systems and for testing those plans, as well as for implementing and enforcing backup procedures. Moreover, the agency had documented and tested contingency plans for its systems and improved continuity of operations controls for several systems. Nevertheless, the control weaknesses can be attributed in part to IRS’s inconsistent implementation of elements of its agency-wide information security program. The agency established a comprehensive framework for its program, including assessing risk for its systems, developing system security plans, and providing employees with security awareness and specialized training. However, IRS had not updated key mainframe policies and procedures to address issues such as comprehensively auditing and monitoring access. In addition, the agency had not fully addressed previously identified deficiencies or ensured that its corrective actions were effective. During our most recent review, IRS told us it had addressed 28 of our prior recommendations; however, we determined that 9 of these had not been effectively implemented. The collective effect of the deficiencies in information security from prior years that continued to exist in fiscal year 2015, along with the new deficiencies we identified, are serious enough to merit the attention of those charged with governance of IRS and therefore represented a significant deficiency in IRS’s internal control over financial reporting systems as of September 30, 2015. To assist IRS in fully implementing its agency-wide information security program, we made two new recommendations to more effectively implement security-related policies and plans. In addition, to assist IRS in strengthening security controls over the financial and tax processing systems we reviewed, we made 43 technical recommendations in a separate report with limited distribution to address 26 new weaknesses in access controls and configuration management. Implementing these recommendations—in addition to the 49 outstanding recommendations from previous audits—will help IRS improve its controls for identifying and authenticating users, limiting users’ access to the minimum necessary to perform their job-related functions, protecting sensitive data when they are stored or in transit, auditing and monitoring system activities, and physically securing its IT facilities and resources. Table 1 below provides the number of our prior recommendations to IRS that were not implemented at the beginning of our fiscal year 2015 audit, how many were resolved by the end of the audit, new recommendations, and the total number of outstanding recommendations at the conclusion of the audit. In commenting on drafts of our reports presenting the results of our fiscal year 2015 audit, the IRS Commissioner stated that while the agency agreed with our new recommendations, it will review them to ensure that its actions include sustainable fixes that implement appropriate security controls balanced against IT and human capital resource limitations. In addition, IRS can take steps to improve its response to data breaches. Specifically, in December 2013 we reported on the extent to which data breach policies at eight agencies, including IRS, adhered to requirements and guidance set forth by the Office of Management and Budget and the National Institute of Standards and Technology. While the agencies in our review generally had policies and procedures in place that reflected the major elements of an effective data breach response program, implementation of these policies and procedures was not consistent. With respect to IRS, we determined that its policies and procedures generally reflected key practices, although the agency did not require considering the number of affected individuals as a factor when determining if affected individuals should be notified of a suspected breach. In addition, IRS did not document lessons learned from periodic analyses of its breach response efforts. We recommended that IRS correct these weaknesses, but the agency has yet to fully address them. The importance of protecting taxpayer information is further highlighted by the billions of dollars that have been lost to IDT refund fraud, which continues to be an evolving threat. IRS develops estimates of the extent of IDT refund fraud to help direct its efforts to identify and prevent the crime. While its estimates have inherent uncertainty, IRS estimated that it prevented or recovered $22.5 billion in fraudulent IDT refunds in filing season 2014 (see figure 1). However, IRS also estimated, where data were available, that it paid $3.1 billion in fraudulent IDT refunds. Because of the difficulties in knowing the amount of undetectable fraud, the actual amount could differ from these estimates. IRS has taken steps to address IDT refund fraud; however, it remains a persistent and continually changing threat. IRS recognized the challenge of IDT refund fraud in its fiscal year 2014-2017 strategic plan and increased resources dedicated to combating IDT and other types of refund fraud. In fiscal year 2015, IRS reported that it staffed more than 4,000 full-time equivalents and spent about $470 million on all refund fraud and IDT activities. As described above, IRS received an additional $290 million for fiscal year 2016 to improve customer service, IDT identification and prevention, and cybersecurity efforts and the agency plans to use $16.1 million of this funding to help prevent IDT refund fraud, among other things. The administration requested an additional $90 million and an additional 491 full-time equivalents for fiscal year 2017 to help prevent IDT refund fraud and reduce other improper payments. IRS estimates that this $90 million investment in IDT refund fraud and other improper payment prevention would help it protect $612 million in revenue in fiscal year 2017, as well as protect revenue in future years. IRS has taken action to improve customer service related to IDT refund fraud. For example, between the 2011 and 2015 filing seasons, IRS experienced a 430 percent increase in the number of telephone calls to its Identity Theft Toll Free Line—as of March 19, 2016, IRS had received over 1.1 million calls to this line. Moreover, 77 percent of callers seeking assistance on this telephone line received it compared to 54 percent during the same period last year. Average wait times during the same period have also decreased—taxpayers are waiting an average of 14 minutes to talk to an assistor, a decrease from 27 minutes last year. IRS also works with third parties, such as tax preparation industry participants, states, and financial institutions to try to detect and prevent IDT refund fraud. In March 2015, the IRS Commissioner convened a Security Summit with industry and states to improve information sharing and authentication. IRS officials said that 40 state departments of revenue and 20 tax industry participants have officially signed a partnership agreement to enact recommendations developed and agreed to by summit participants. IRS plans to invest a portion of the $16.1 million it received in fiscal year 2016 into identity theft prevention and refund fraud mitigation actions from the Security Summit. These efforts include developing an Information Sharing and Analysis Center where IRS, states, and industry can share information to combat IDT refund fraud. Even though IRS has prioritized combating IDT refund fraud, fraudsters adapt their schemes to identify weaknesses in IDT defenses, such as gaining access to taxpayers’ tax return transcripts through IRS’s online Get Transcript service. According to IRS officials, with access to tax transcripts, fraudsters can create historically consistent returns that are hard to distinguish from a return filed by a legitimate taxpayer, potentially making it more difficult for IRS to identify and detect IDT refund fraud. Without additional action by IRS and Congress, the risk of issuing fraudulent IDT refunds could grow. We previously made recommendations to IRS to help it better combat IDT refund fraud: Authentication. In January 2015, we reported that IRS’s authentication tools have limitations and recommended that IRS assess the costs, benefits and risks of its authentication tools. For example, individuals can obtain an e-file PIN by providing their name, Social Security number, date of birth, address, and filing status for IRS’s e-file PIN application. Identity thieves can easily find this information, allowing them to bypass some, if not all, of IRS’s automatic checks, according to our analysis and interviews with tax software and return preparer associations and companies. After filing an IDT return using an e-file PIN, the fraudulent return would proceed through IRS’s normal return processing. In November 2015, IRS officials told us that the agency had developed guidance for its Identity Assurance Office to assess costs, benefits, and risk, and that its analysis will inform decision-making on authentication-related issues. IRS also noted that the methods of analysis for the authentication tools will vary depending on the different costs and other factors for authenticating taxpayers in different channels, such as online, phone, or in-person. In February 2016, IRS officials told us that the Identity Assurance Office plans to complete a strategic plan for taxpayer authentication across the agency in September 2016. While IRS is taking steps, it will still be vulnerable until it completes and uses the results of its analysis of costs, benefits, and risk to inform decision-making. Form W-2, Wage and Tax Statement (W-2) Pre-refund Matching. In August 2014 we reported that the wage information that employers report on Form W-2 is not available to IRS until after it issues most refunds, and that if IRS had access to W-2 data earlier, it could match such information to taxpayers’ returns and identify discrepancies before issuing billions of dollars of fraudulent IDT refunds. We recommended that IRS assess the costs and benefits of accelerating W-2 deadlines. In response to our recommendation, IRS provided us with a report in September 2015 discussing (1) adjustments to IRS systems and work processes needed to use accelerated W-2 information, (2) the potential impacts on internal and external stakeholders, and (3) other changes needed to match W-2 data to tax returns prior to issuing refunds, such as delaying refunds until W-2 data are available. In December 2015, the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2016 amended the tax code to accelerate W-2 filing deadlines to January 31. IRS’s report will help IRS determine how to best implement pre- refund W-2 matching, given the new January 31st deadline for filing W-2s. Additionally, we suggested that Congress should consider providing the Secretary of the Treasury with the regulatory authority to lower the threshold for electronic filing of W-2s, which could make more W-2 information available to IRS earlier. External Leads. IRS partners with financial institutions and other external parties to obtain information about emerging IDT refund trends and fraudulent returns that have passed through IRS detection systems. In August 2014, we reported that IRS provides limited feedback to external parties on IDT external leads they submit and offers external parties limited general information on IDT refund fraud trends and recommended that IRS provide actionable feedback to all lead generating third parties. In November 2015, IRS reported that it had developed a database to track leads submitted by financial institutions and the results of those leads. IRS also stated that it had held two sessions with financial institutions to provide feedback on external leads provided to IRS. In December 2015, IRS officials stated that the agency sent a customer satisfaction survey asking financial institutions for feedback on the external leads process and was considering other ways to provide feedback to financial institutions. In April 2016, IRS officials stated they plan to analyze preliminary survey results by mid-April 2016. Additionally, IRS officials reported that the agency shared information with financial institutions in March 2016 and plans to do so on a quarterly basis, with the next information sharing session scheduled in June 2016. IRS and industry partners have characterized that returns processing and refund issuance during this filing season has been generally smooth. Through April 1, 2016, IRS had processed about 95 million returns and issued 76 million refunds totaling about $215 billion. While IRS experienced a major system failure in February that halted returns processing for about a day, the agency reported that it had minimal effect on overall processing of returns and refunds. In addition to filing returns, many taxpayers often call IRS for assistance. IRS’s telephone service has generally improved in 2016 over last year. From January 1 through March 19, 2016 IRS received about 35.4 million calls to its automated and live assistor telephone lines, about a 2 percent decrease compared to the same period last year. Of the 13.4 million calls seeking live assistance, IRS had answered 9.1 million calls—a 75 percent increase over the 5.2 million calls answered during the same period last year. IRS anticipated that 65 percent of callers seeking live assistance would receive it this filing season, which runs through April 18, and 47 percent of callers would receive live assistance through the entire 2016 fiscal year. As of March 19, 2016, 75 percent of callers had received live assistance, an increase from 38 percent during the same period last year. Further, the average wait time to speak to an assistor also decreased from 24 to 9 minutes. As we reported in March 2016, however, IRS’s telephone level of service for the full fiscal year has yet to reach the levels it had achieved in earlier years. IRS attributed this year’s service improvement to a number of factors. Of the additional $290 million IRS received in December 2015, it allocated $178.4 million (61.5 percent) for taxpayer services to make measurable improvements in its telephone level of service. With the funds, IRS hired 1,000 assistors who began answering taxpayer calls in March, in addition to the approximately 2,000 seasonal assistors it had hired in fall 2015. To help answer taxpayer calls before March, IRS officials told us that they detailed 275 staff from one of its compliance functions to answer telephone calls. IRS officials said they believe this step was necessary because the additional funding came too late in the year to hire and train assistors to fully cover the filing season. IRS also plans to use about 600 full-time equivalents of overtime for assistors to answer telephone calls and respond to correspondence in fiscal year 2016, compared to fewer than 60 full-time equivalents of overtime used in fiscal year 2015. In December 2014, we recommended that IRS systematically and periodically compare its telephone service to the best in business to identify gaps between actual and desired performance. IRS disagreed with this recommendation, noting that it is difficult to identify comparable organizations. We do not agree with IRS’s position; many organizations run call centers that would provide ample opportunities to benchmark IRS’s performance. In fall 2015, Department of the Treasury (Treasury) and IRS officials said they had no plans to develop a comprehensive customer service strategy or specific goals for telephone service tied to the best in the business and customer expectations. Without such a strategy, Treasury and IRS can neither measure nor effectively communicate to Congress the types and levels of customer service taxpayers should expect and the resources needed to reach those levels. Therefore, in December 2015 we suggested that Congress consider requiring that Treasury work with IRS to develop a comprehensive customer service strategy. In April 2016, IRS officials told us that the agency established a team to consider our prior work in developing this strategy or benchmarking its telephone service. In summary, while IRS has made progress in implementing information security controls, it needs to continue to address weaknesses in access controls and configuration management and consistently implement all elements of its information security program. The risks IRS and the public are exposed to have been illustrated by recent incidents involving public- facing applications, highlighting the importance of securing systems that contain sensitive taxpayer and financial data. In addition, fully implementing key elements of a breach response program will help ensure that when breaches of sensitive data do occur, their impact on affected individuals will be minimized. Weaknesses in information security can also increase the risk posed by identity theft refund fraud. IRS needs to establish an approach for addressing identity theft refund fraud that is informed by assessing the cost, benefits, and risks of IRS’s various authentication options and improving the reliability of fraud estimates. While this year’s tax filing season has generally gone smoothly and IRS has improved customer service, it still needs to develop a comprehensive approach to customer service that will meet the needs of taxpayers while ensuring that their sensitive information is adequately protected.

Thus it is critical that sensitive taxpayer and other data are protected. Recent data breaches at IRS highlight the vulnerability of taxpayer information. In addition, identity theft refund fraud is an evolving threat to honest taxpayers and tax administration. This crime occurs when a thief files a fraudulent return using a legitimate taxpayer's identity and claims a refund. In 2015, GAO added identity theft refund fraud to its high-risk area on the enforcement of tax laws and expanded its government-wide high-risk area on federal information security to include the protection of personally identifiable information. This statement discusses (1) IRS information security controls over financial and tax processing systems, (2) IRS actions to address identity theft refund fraud, and (3) the status of selected IRS filing season operations. This statement is based on previously published GAO work as well as an update of selected data. In March 2016, GAO reported that the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) had instituted numerous controls over key financial and tax processing systems; however, it had not always effectively implemented other controls intended to properly restrict access to systems and information, among other security measures. In particular, while IRS had improved some of its access controls, weaknesses remained in key controls for identifying and authenticating users, authorizing users' level of rights and privileges, encrypting sensitive data, auditing and monitoring network activity, and physically securing facilities housing its information technology resources. These weaknesses were due in part to IRS's inconsistent implementation of its agency-wide security program, including not fully implementing prior GAO recommendations. GAO concluded that these weaknesses collectively constituted a significant deficiency for the purposes of financial reporting for fiscal year 2015. As a result, taxpayer and financial data continue to be exposed to unnecessary risk. Identity theft refund fraud also poses a significant challenge. IRS estimates it paid $3.1 billion in these fraudulent refunds in filing season 2014, while preventing $22.5 billion (see figure). The full extent is unknown because of the challenges inherent in detecting this form of fraud. IRS has taken steps to combat identity theft refund fraud such as improving phone service for taxpayers to report suspected identity theft and working with industry, states, and financial institutions to detect and prevent it. However, as GAO reported in August 2014 and January 2015, additional actions can further assist the agency in addressing this crime, including pre-refund matching of taxpayer returns with information returns from employers, and assessing the costs, benefits, and risks of improving methods for authenticating taxpayers. In addition, the Consolidated Appropriations Act 2016 includes a provision that would help IRS with pre-refund matching and also includes an additional $290 million to enhance cybersecurity, combat identity theft refund fraud, and improve customer service. According to IRS and industry partners, the 2016 filing season has generally gone smoothly, with about 95 million returns and $215 billion in refunds processed through April 1, 2016. In addition, IRS increased its level of phone service to taxpayers, although it has not developed a comprehensive strategy for customer service as GAO recommended in December 2015. In addition to 49 prior recommendations that had not been implemented, GAO made 45 new recommendations to IRS to further improve its information security controls and the implementation of its agency-wide information security program. GAO has also made recommendations to help IRS combat identity theft refund fraud, such as assessing costs, benefits, and risks of taxpayer authentication options.\"}\n",
      "{'document': 'In 1991, we reported that, historically, INS leadership had allowed INS’ organizational structure to become decentralized without adequate controls. Specifically, its regional structure had created geographical separation among INS programs and hampered resource allocation and consistent program implementation. The field structure designed to carry out INS’ enforcement functions was bifurcated between districts and Border Patrol sectors, resulting in uncoordinated, overlapping programs. In addition, only a single senior INS headquarters manager supervised INS’ 33 district directors and 21 Border Patrol chiefs. In 1994, with the appointment of a new Commissioner, INS implemented an organizational structure intended to remedy at least two problems. First, the headquarters operations office’s unrealistically large span of control resulting in uneven and poorly coordinated field performance. Second, the lack of focus on program planning resulting from the operations office’s preoccupation with matters that should have been handled by field managers. The Commissioner shifted some management authority to officials closer to field activities. While INS made some progress toward achieving its reorganization goals, its organizational structure is still in a state of flux and some problems persist. For example, in 1997 we reported that the responsibilities and authority of the Office of Field Operations and Office of Programs were unclear. We recommended, among other things, that the INS Commissioner provide written guidance on (1) the responsibilities and authorities of these two offices and (2) the appropriate coordination and communication methods between these two offices, and between the Office of Programs and field offices. Although INS has taken some steps to implement our 1997 recommendations, they have yet to be completed because, according to INS, these recommendations relate to INS restructuring that is currently under study. As previously mentioned, INS’ mission involves carrying out two primary functions—enforcing immigration laws and providing services or benefits to eligible legal immigrants. These functions often translate into competing priorities at the program level that need to be balanced for effective program implementation. All too often, the emphasis placed on one over the other results in ineffective enforcement or poor benefit delivery. An example of this inability to balance these priorities can be found in our September 2000 report on the processing of visas for specialty occupations, called H-1B visas. The performance appraisal process for staff that evaluates the merits of applications filed with INS (called adjudicators) focused mainly on the number of applications reviewed, not the quality of the review. INS rewarded those adjudicators who processed the greatest number of applications over those who processed fewer applications. Some adjudicators told us that because of pressure to adjudicate cases quickly, they did not routinely use investigations staff to look into potentially fraudulent applications because doing so would take more time and reduce the number of applications they could complete. INS investigators following up on approved applications found instances of fraud; for example, they found employers who created shell corporations and false credentials and documents for aliens ineligible for H-1B employment. We found other examples where the goal of providing timely service delivery has negatively impacted INS’ enforcement goal of providing benefits to only eligible aliens. In our May 2001 report on INS application processing, we stated that INS’ policy is to grant work authorization to applicants who file for adjustment of status to that of a permanent resident before it adjudicates their application. This policy is intended to prevent aliens from having to wait for INS to adjudicate their application before they can work. However, in fiscal year 2000 INS denied about 80,000 applicants for adjustment of status (about 14 percent of all the adjustment of status applications completed) and had to revoke their work authorization. Because these aliens had work authorization while waiting for their application to be processed, they could have developed a work history that may have facilitated their obtaining employment even after INS’ efforts to officially revoke their work authorization. A senior INS official stated that the policy to grant work authorization before the adjustment of status application is decided is intended to be fair to the majority of adjustment of status applicants who are approved. An investigation into INS’ initiative to process naturalization applications more quickly found the initiative to be fraught with quality and integrity problems resulting in ineligible applicants receiving citizenship. According to a Department of Justice Office of Inspector General (OIG) report on INS’ Citizenship USA initiative launched in 1995, INS made the timely completion of naturalization applications its guiding principle at the expense of accuracy and quality in determining eligibility. As a result of the problems found, INS instituted naturalization quality control procedures to enhance the integrity of the process. We are finding a similar situation in our ongoing review for this subcommittee of INS’ efforts to deter immigration benefit fraud. We will discuss this and other issues related to immigration benefit fraud in a report to be released later this year. Other researchers have also found that INS had difficulty in balancing its enforcement and service delivery priorities. For example, the Visa Waiver Program allows nationals of certain counties to enter the United States with just a passport. No visa is required. According to a Department of Justice OIG report, abuse of the program poses a threat to national security and increases illegal immigration. The report found that aliens used stolen passports from Visa Waiver countries to illegally enter the United States. In one case, the OIG found that 27 stolen Icelandic passports had been used to smuggle children into the United States.Although the passport numbers of the stolen Icelandic passports had been entered into a lookout database, INS airport inspectors were not entering the passport numbers of passengers arriving with Icelandic passports into the lookout database. INS officials told the OIG investigators that manually keying in these passport numbers into the system would take too long and would hamper INS’ ability to inspect all passengers from a flight within 45 minutes, as mandated by law. An INS contractor that evaluated INS’ immigration benefits process in 1999 found that INS needed to strengthen the integrity of the process. The study found that INS had no standard quality control program for ensuring that applications were processed consistently. Although some adjudicators believed the number of fraudulent applications submitted was significantly higher than the number they were detecting, they received little training in fraud detection. According to the report, some management and operations personnel indicated that performance evaluations in large part are based on the quantity of applications processed. The report concluded that whether employees receive incentives and rewards depends more on the quantity of applications processed rather than on fraud detection. Therefore, adjudicators had no incentives to actively search out fraud. As we reported in our applications processing report, despite these pressures to complete applications more quickly, INS’ backlog of applications increased to about 4 million applications by the end of fiscal year 2000, a four-fold increase since 1994. As of September 30, 2001 about 767,000 applicants out of almost 3 million with pending applications had been waiting at least 21 months for INS to process their application. In our 1997 management report, we found that poor communication was a problem, especially between headquarters and field units. For example, field and policy manuals were out of date and there was not one place that program staff could go for direction. Over one half of the employees we surveyed in preparing that report believed that INS had poor communications and that information was disseminated poorly. As noted earlier in our testimony, how INS’ Office of Programs and Office of Field Operations were to coordinate was still unclear. Our recent work shows that coordination and communication is still a problem. For example, although both the Border Patrol and INS’ Office of Investigations have anti-smuggling units that conduct alien smuggling investigations, these units operate through separate chains of command with different reporting structures. In May 2000, we reported that alien smuggling was a growing problem, and that the Border Patrol and Investigations anti-smuggling units operated autonomously, resulting in a lack of program coordination. Further, this lack of coordination sometimes led to different anti-smuggling units opening investigations on the same target. INS Investigations officials told us that the autonomy of the individual units and the lack of a single chain of command to manage INS’ anti-smuggling investigations were major obstacles to building a more effective anti-smuggling program. Communicating the necessary information to the appropriate individuals has also been a problem. In our H-1B report, we stated that adjudicators told us that they did not have easy access to case-specific information that would have helped them correctly decide whether an application should be approved or denied. For example, evidence of a fraudulent employer or falsified worker credentials either was not available to the adjudicator or could only be accessed through a time-consuming and complicated process. Consequently, a previously denied application could be resubmitted and approved by a different adjudicator. At the time of our review, INS officials told us that INS was in the process of upgrading the computer system that tracks H-1B applications, which could make more accurate and up to date information available on-line for adjudicators. Our work and the work of an INS contractor both found that INS did not have a structure in place to manage the information that adjudicators needed to make correct decisions. Information systems were not easily accessible to all adjudicators, so these systems were generally not queried as part of the adjudication process. INS had no single repository of information where adjudicators could find the most up to date information on such things as adjudication processes and legal and regulatory policies. In one case, the lack of communication and unclear policies and procedures had tragic consequences. In January 1999, police in Texas obtained a warrant for the arrest of Rafael Resendez-Ramirez, the “railway killer” who traveled around the United States by freight train and committed murders near railroad lines. In early 1999 police contacted INS Investigations staff in Houston Texas several times about placing a “border lookout” for Resendez-Ramirez in case he was apprehended at the border. According to a Department of Justice OIG report, none of the Investigations staff contacted by the police thought to inform the police about the existence of IDENT, INS’ automated fingerprint identification system. The Investigations staff also failed to enter a lookout in IDENT in case Resendez-Ramirez was apprehended trying to cross the border. On June 1, 1999, the Border Patrol apprehended Resendez-Ramirez trying to cross illegally and had him processed through the IDENT system. Because no border lookout had been placed, however, the Border Patrol voluntarily returned him to Mexico in accordance with standard Border Patrol practices. He subsequently returned illegally to the United States and committed four more murders before he was captured. INS’ Houston investigations staff provided OIG investigators with various reasons as to why they did not mention IDENT or its lookout capability to police or enter a lookout in IDENT, including the following: They were unfamiliar with IDENT and how it worked. They never received any IDENT training. They were unaware IDENT had a lookout feature. They thought IDENT was a system primarily for the Border Patrol to use. The OIG concluded that the lack of knowledge about IDENT was largely the result of broader problems in the way INS implemented and monitored IDENT. INS failed to (1) (1) ensure that components outside of the Border Patrol, such as Investigations, understood IDENT policies, particularly the lookout policy and (2) provide adequate IDENT training for all INS staff. INS and the FBI are currently working on integrating IDENT with the FBI’s automated fingerprint system to improve the quality and accuracy of criminal identification so that such mistakes can be averted in the future. Effective communication has also been a problem between INS and local communities. In August 2001, we reported that since 1994 as INS’ Border Patrol has increased enforcement efforts in certain locations as part of its strategy to deter illegal entry along the southwest border, illegal alien traffic shifted to other locations. Officials from some border communities told us that they were caught by surprise by the increase in the number of illegal aliens apprehended in their communities. INS has recognized the need to improve communications with the public regarding its strategy and its potential implications and has increased its outreach efforts. INS has had long-standing difficulty developing and fielding information systems to support its program operations. In 1990, we reported that INS managers and field officials did not have adequate, reliable, and timely information to effectively carry out the Service’s mission. We also reported that INS had not conducted a comprehensive agency-wide information needs assessment. As a result, program and management data were kept in a loose collection of automated systems as well as a number of ad-hoc labor-intensive manual systems. Effectively using information technology continues to remain a challenge for INS. In August 2000, we reported that INS did not have a “blueprint” to guide the development of its information systems. The absence of such a plan increases the risk that the information systems in which hundreds of millions of dollars are invested each year will not be well integrated or compatible and will not support mission needs. In December 2000, we reported that INS had limited capability to effectively manage its planned and ongoing information technology investments. While INS has some important information technology management capabilities in place, it has to do considerable work to fully implement mature and effective processes. The Department of Justice agreed with our recommendation that INS develop and submit a plan to Justice for implementing investment management process improvements. INS is in the process of developing this plan. The lack of adequate information technology systems has significantly impacted INS’ ability to perform its core missions. As we reported in our applications processing report, INS headquarters and field staff cited automation problems as the number one factor affecting INS’ ability to process applications in a timely manner to reduce backlogs. INS has no national case management system for applications filed at its 33 district offices. Most of these offices process applications manually. As a result, these offices cannot determine the number of pending cases, identify problem areas or bottlenecks, establish processing priorities, deploy staff based on workload, and ensure cases are processed in the order received. Due to the lack of any automated system, staff spend considerable time responding to applicants’ inquires on the status of their case, which takes time away from application processing. Existing INS systems used to process applications do not provide accurate and reliable data. In our applications processing report we stated that the system INS Service Centers use to process some applications frequently fails to operate and does not always update data to INS’ mainframe computer as it should. This lack of automation has resulted in INS expending considerable time and effort to obtain the data it needs. In our applications processing report we also stated that lack of reliable data was the primary reason INS undertook a time-consuming and costly hand-count of all pending applications in September 2000. INS undertook the hand-count to get an accurate count of pending applications hoping to obtain an unqualified opinion on its fiscal year 2000 financial statements. According to INS officials, the cost to complete this hand-count was high in terms of lost production and staff time. INS suspended nearly all case processing for 2-3 weeks. Due to the lack of accurate data in its computer systems, INS will have to do another hand-count of all pending applications at the end of fiscal year 2001 if it hopes to obtain an unqualified opinion on its financial statement. As a result of this lack of accurate data, INS has also approved more visas than the Congress has allowed. According to an INS contractor study, INS’ system that tracks these visas was not designed to keep a running total of the number of visas issued and to compare it against the annual limit to ensure that only the allowable number is approved. Consequently, in fiscal year 1999, INS approved approximately 137,000 to 138,000 H-1B visas, well over the 115,000 limit. Program management issues at INS have caused continuing concern. Our work indicates that INS needs to improve its program management in several fundamental areas, including having efficient processes and clear policies and procedures, providing adequate staff training, and aligning its workforce with its workload. The INS contractor study on immigration benefits processing found that INS’ processes were inefficient. For example, INS staff spends considerable time re-entering the same data into various INS computer systems. INS did not consistently adjudicate applications because the procedures used to process applications varied by office, most field offices allowed adjudicators to review cases using minimal guidelines, and standard quality controls were lacking. The study made numerous recommendations on how to make the processes more efficient and improve quality control. We stated in our applications processing report that INS was developing a strategic plan to reengineer applications processing. INS will make decisions regarding the contractor’s recommendations after completing two related strategic plans - the plan to reengineer applications processing and the information technology strategic plan. Both are in the early planning stages. INS estimated that it will take 5 years or more to develop and implement the reengineered processes and implement a service-wide automated system to process applications. Adequate staff training is also a critical aspect of program management. As noted earlier in our testimony, an INS contractor study found that INS adjudicators received little training in fraud detection. According to a November 2000 INS report prepared as part of INS’ Government Performance and Results Act reporting requirements, the INS workforce is not well supported in terms of training. Advanced training classes have been cut back or delayed. According to the report, because of the growing workforce and these training cutbacks, INS will have a larger portion of its workforce that is relatively inexperienced and inadequately trained for its work.', 'summary': \"The Immigration and Naturalization's (INS) organizational structure has led to recurring management problems, including an inability to balance competing priorities, poor communications, and weaknesses in the development and fielding of critical information technology. Although restructuring may help, INS will still need to assemble the basic building blocks essential to any organization. These building blocks include clearly delineated roles and responsibilities, policies and procedures that effectively balance competing priorities, effective internal and external communication and coordination, and computer systems that provide accurate and timely information. Until these element are in place, it will be difficult to enforce the nation's immigration laws effectively.\"}\n"
